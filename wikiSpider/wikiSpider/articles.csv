,Benevolent dictator for life, (,BDFL,) is a title given to a small number of ,open-source software development, leaders, typically project founders who retain the final say in disputes or arguments within the community. The phrase originated in 1995 with reference to ,Guido van Rossum,, creator of the ,Python programming language,.,[1],[2],
,
,
,History,[,edit,],
,Shortly after Van Rossum joined the ,Corporation for National Research Initiatives,, the term appeared in a follow-up mail by Ken Manheimer to a meeting trying to create a semi-formal group that would oversee Python development and workshops; this initial use included an additional joke of naming Van Rossum the ""First Interim BDFL"". According to Rossum, the title was most likely created by Ken Manheimer or ,Barry Warsaw,[1],
,In July 2018, Van Rossum announced that he would be stepping down as BDFL of Python without appointing a successor, effectively eliminating the title within the Python community structure.,[3],
,
,Usage,[,edit,],
,BDFL should not be confused with the more common term for open-source leaders, ""benevolent dictator"", which was popularized by ,Eric S. Raymond,'s essay "",Homesteading the Noosphere,"" (1999).,[4],
,Among other topics related to ,hacker culture,, Raymond elaborates on how the nature of open source forces the ""dictatorship"" to keep itself benevolent, since a strong disagreement can lead to the ,forking, of the project under the rule of new leaders.,[,citation needed,],

,Warm Showers, (WS) is a non-profit ,hospitality exchange service, for people engaging in ,bicycle touring,. The platform is a ,gift economy, — hosts are not supposed to charge for ,lodging, and are not bound.,[2],[3],[4],[5],[6],[7],  The legal form is a Colorado ,501(c)(3), ,nonprofit organization, headquartered in ,Boulder, Colorado,, US.,[8],
,The platform has been described as a ""cyclists’ support network whose members may offer free amenities and services such as meals and lodging"".,[9], ,Rough Guides, recommends Warm Showers as means to improve security of ,solo female cyclists,.,[10], Warm Showers helps bicycle travelers to balance the self-reliance of camping and hotels with opportunities for social encounters.,[11], Warm Showers has a positive effect on rural communities, both socially and economically.,[12], Many users of the platform cycle for health reasons or to reduce their ,carbon footprint, and to be ,environmentally friendly,.,[13],[2], Cultural exchange and social connection do also play a role.,[14],[3],[15],
,The organization received donations of $100,641 in 2015, $84,009 in 2016, $115,324 in 2017, $128,626 in 2018 and $111,089 in 2019.,[8],[16],[17],[18], 
,
,
,History,[,edit,],
,The concept was inspired by cyclist John Mosley in 1976 by placing an ad in the U.S. magazine ,Bike World,, which requested to sign up for a hospitality list.,[14], A list of 800 names and contact infos was put into a ,rolodex, for almost 30 years. The name of the organization was ,Touring Cyclist Hospitality Directory, back then. Mosley provided touring cyclists with copies of pages from the rolodex.
,A Canadian couple, Terry Zmrhal and Geoff Cashmen, founded Warm Showers in 1993 as a continuation of Touring Cyclist Hospitality Directory.,[14],[19],[20], They created a database from the existing members of biking-hospitality organizations. In 1996, Roger Gravel became responsible for the platform.,[21], In 2005, Randy Fay created the website based on the existing database.,[19], 
,As of 2018, Seth Portner was the executive director of Warm Showers.,[18],[8],[17], In 2019, Tahverlee Anglen provided management services.,[16],
,
,Membership statistics,[,edit,],
,Cycle touring over the ,Eriskay, - South Uist causeway,
,In 2018, 53% of members were based in Europe and 30% in North America.,[22],

,
,Homestay requests,[,edit,],
,Warm Showers grants trustworthy teams of scientists access to its ,anonymized data, for publication of insights to the benefit of humanity. In 2015, an analysis of 97,915 ,homestay, requests from ,BeWelcome, and 285,444 homestay requests from Warm Showers showed general regularity — the less time is spent on writing a homestay request, the lower is the probability of success. Since both networks are shaped by ,altruism,, low-effort communication, aka 'copy and paste requests', evidently sends the wrong ,signal,.,[24],

,Linux.com, is a website owned by the ,Linux Foundation,. The goal of the site is to provide information about the developments and changes in Linux and related products.,[1],  Linux.com offers free Linux tutorials, news and blogs, discussion forums and groups, a Linux software and hardware directory, and a job board.,[2],
,
,
,History,[,edit,],
,Originally, the site was owned by Andover.net, which was taken over by VA Linux Systems (which later changed into VA Software, and then SourceForge, Inc., now ,Geeknet,). It was dedicated to providing news and services to the free and open source software community. The site reported 25 million hits in the first month of operation.
,Linux.com suspended the publication of new articles in December 2008, but implied in an announcement on New Year's Day 2009 that publication would shortly resume after unspecified changes to the site; legal considerations were given as the reason why the anticipated changes were not clearly described.,[3],
,On March 3, 2009, the ,Linux Foundation, announced that they would be taking over management of Linux.com.,[4],

,Crypt of Worcester Cathedral,
,
,Nicholas of Worcester, (died 1124) was the ,prior, of the ,Benedictine, priory of ,Worcester Cathedral, ,(crypt pictured), from about 1115 until his death. He was born around the time of the ,Norman Conquest,. It is not known who his parents were, but ,William of Malmesbury, wrote that he was ""of exalted descent"", and it has been argued that he was a son of King ,Harold Godwinson,. Nicholas was the favourite pupil of ,Wulfstan,, the ,bishop of Worcester,, who brought him up. Wulfstan was influential in transmitting Old English culture to Anglo-Norman England, and Nicholas carried on this work as prior. He was respected by the chroniclers William of Malmesbury, ,John of Worcester, and ,Eadmer, for his assistance with their histories. Nicholas was an English monk at a time when both Englishmen and monks rarely received promotion in the church, and when Bishop ,Theulf, of Worcester died in October 1123, Nicholas led an unsuccessful attempt of the monks of the priory chapter to be allowed to choose the next bishop.

,Acraea terpsicore,, commonly known as the tawny coster, is a species of butterfly in the  ,Nymphalidae, family, the brush-footed butterflies. It is found across eastern Asia from India and Sri Lanka to Singapore, Indonesia and the Maldives and, more recently, Australia. It is small, with a size of 53–64 millimetres (2.1–2.5 in), has leathery wings and is common in grassland and scrub habitats. ,Acraea terpsicore, has a weak fluttery flight and is avoided by most insect predators. This ,A. terpsicore, individual was photographed in ,Komodo National Park,, Indonesia.

 Diese Seite wurde zuletzt am 23. Dezember 2023 um 17:21 Uhr bearbeitet.,"Benevolent Dictator for Life, (,BDFL,; ,englisch, für ,Wohlwollender Diktator auf Lebenszeit,) ist eine Bezeichnung für eine Person mit der leitenden Rolle in einem ,Freie-Software,-Projekt mit einer Organisationsstruktur, bei der bezeichnenderweise in wichtigen Entscheidungen de facto kein Weg an der so betitelten Person vorbeiführt.,[1],[2],
Der Begriff wurde vermutlich 1995 von ,Ken Manheimer, geprägt, als er ,Guido van Rossum, in einer ,E-Mail, den Titel „BDFL“ verlieh – als Rolle in einem gerade gegründeten Gremium zur ,Programmiersprache, ,Python,. Ältere Versionen des ,Wikipedia,-Artikels führten den Begriff auf einen ,Monty-Python,-Sketch zurück, worauf van Rossum die ursprüngliche E-Mail veröffentlichte, um diese Verbindung endgültig zu widerlegen.,[3],[4],[5],[6],
,Die Bezeichnung fand dann innerhalb der Freie-Software-Szene weite Verbreitung und wurde auf zahlreiche weitere Personen mit entsprechenden Rollen in anderen Projekten übertragen. Zum Teil geben sich diese Personen aus eigenem kritischem Bewusstsein für ihre Rolle auch selbst diesen oder ähnliche Titel, wofür ,Mark Shuttleworth, von ,Ubuntu,-Linux ein bekanntes Beispiel abgibt (als ,engl., ,Self-Appointed Benevolent Dictator for Life,, ,SABDFL, – deutsch: „Selbsternannter wohlwollender Diktator auf Lebenszeit“).,[7],[8],[9],
,Sollte dennoch ein BDFL zurücktreten, bzw. sich selbst von seinen Aufgaben entbinden, so spricht man von einem ,BDFL ,Emeritus,.,[10],
,Eric S. Raymond, deutet in seinem ,Open-Source,- und ,Hacker,-Kultur-Essay ,Homesteading the Noosphere, (1999) auch den Begriff „benevolent dictator“.,[11], Raymond führt aus, wie die Natur des Open Source dazu führt, dass ein solcher „Diktator“ ,altruistisch, bleibt, da bei zu starken Dissonanzen eine ,Spaltung des Projekts, unter anderer Leitung jederzeit möglich ist.

" Ĉi tiu paĝo estis lastafoje redaktita je 12:52, 23 feb. 2024.","Dumviva bonvola diktatoro, (angle: ,Benevolent dictator for life,) estas titolo donata al malgranda nombro de ĉefprogramistoj de ,libera programaro,, kutime la fondintoj de la projektoj, kiuj fine juĝas dum disputoj en la komunumo. La esprimo ekaperis en 1995 rilate al ,Guido van Rossum,, kreinto de la ,programlingvo, ,Python,.,[1],[2],
,Oni ne devas miksi ""dumviva bonvola diktatoro"" kun la plej ofta esprimo por liberprogramaraj ĉefprogramistoj, ""bonintenca diktatoro"", kiu estis popularigita de ,Eric S. Raymond, en lia verko ""Homesteading the Noosphere"" (1999).,[3], En ĉi tiu tezo, Raymond traktas pri kiel la naturo de libera programado daŭre devigas la ""diktaturon"" ,bonintenca,, ĉar granda malkonsento povas generi forkaĵojn el la projekto sub novaj ĉefontoj.

,Ne doit pas être confondu avec ,Dictateur bienveillant,.
,
,
,
,Benevolent Dictator for Life, (,BDFL,) (littéralement « dictateur bienveillant à vie ») est le surnom donné à une personne respectée de la communauté de développement ,open source, qui définit des orientations générales d'un projet donné. Ce nom est un jeu de mots entre ,dictateur bienveillant, et ,président à vie,.
,
,
,Description,[,modifier, | ,modifier le code,],
,Le BDFL est la personne qui détient effectivement des pouvoirs similaires à ceux d'un dictateur sur ce projet. Cependant, les autres développeurs et utilisateurs lui font confiance pour qu'il n'abuse pas de ses pouvoirs. Le terme est utilisé pour plaisanter, car les « sujets » du chef du projet contribuent volontairement, et le produit final pourra être utilisé par tout le monde. Dans ce contexte, un dictateur n'a du pouvoir que sur le processus, et ce uniquement tant que la confiance règne.
,Une variante est ,Self-Appointed Benevolent Dictator for Life, (,SABDFL,), littéralement « bienveillant dictateur à vie autoproclamé ».
C'est le pseudonyme du milliardaire sud-africain ,Mark Shuttleworth,, reflétant ainsi l'influence qu'il exerce sur la communauté ,Ubuntu,.
,Par extension, cette dénomination a également été donnée à certains fondateurs de ,tiers-lieux,, lieux où la ,culture libre, et l'absence de hiérarchie est mise en avant. 
,Antoine Burret, ,[,1,],, auteur de ,Tiers-lieux et plus si affinités, ,[,2,], insiste sur la différence avec un « chef », ou supérieur : ,« Il y a une différence importante, c’est qu’il n’y a pas de lien hiérarchique. Celui qui ne veut pas suivre peut partir. J’insiste sur un point : il peut partir et reprendre le projet pour aller dans un autre sens que celui voulu par le premier promoteur. Le pouvoir n’appartient au dictateur bienveillant que dans la mesure où la communauté lui donne sa confiance. Chacun est libre. », ,[,3,],

,The ,International Standard Book Number, (,ISBN,) is a numeric commercial ,book, ,identifier, that is intended to be unique.,[a],[b], Publishers purchase or receive ISBNs from an affiliate of the International ISBN Agency.,[2],
,A different ISBN is assigned to each separate edition and variation of a publication, but not to a simple reprinting of an existing item. For example, an ,e-book,, a ,paperback, and a ,hardcover, edition of the same ,book, must each have a different ISBN, but an unchanged reprint of the hardcover edition keeps the same ISBN. The ISBN is ten digits long if assigned before 2007, and thirteen digits long if assigned on or after 1 January 2007.,[c], The method of assigning an ISBN is nation-specific and varies between countries, often depending on how large the publishing industry is within a country.
,The first version of the ISBN identification format was devised in 1967, based upon the 9-digit ,Standard Book Numbering, (,SBN,) created in 1966. The 10-digit ISBN format was developed by the ,International Organization for Standardization, (ISO) and was published in 1970 as international standard ISO 2108 (any 9-digit SBN can be converted to a 10-digit ISBN by prefixing it with a zero).
,Privately published books sometimes appear without an ISBN. The International ISBN Agency sometimes assigns ISBNs to such books on its own initiative.,[4],
,A separate identifier code of a similar kind, the ,International Standard Serial Number, (ISSN), identifies periodical publications such as ,magazines, and ,newspapers,. The ,International Standard Music Number, (ISMN) covers ,musical scores,.
,
,
,History,
,The Standard Book Number (SBN) is a commercial system using nine-digit ,code, numbers to identify books. In 1965, British bookseller and stationers ,WHSmith, announced plans to implement a standard numbering system for its books.,[1], They hired consultants to work on their behalf, and the system was devised by ,Gordon Foster,, emeritus professor of statistics at ,Trinity College Dublin,.,[5], The ,International Organization for Standardization, (ISO) Technical Committee on Documentation sought to adapt the British SBN for international use. The ISBN identification format was conceived in 1967 in the United Kingdom by ,David Whitaker,[6],[7], (regarded as the ""Father of the ISBN""),[8], and in 1968 in the United States by Emery Koltay,[6], (who later became director of the U.S. ISBN agency ,R. R. Bowker,).,[8],[9],[10],
,The 10-digit ISBN format was developed by the ISO and was published in 1970 as international standard ISO 2108.,[1],[6], The United Kingdom continued to use the nine-digit SBN code until 1974. ISO has appointed the International ISBN Agency as the ,registration authority, for ISBN worldwide and the ISBN Standard is developed under the control of ISO Technical Committee 46/Subcommittee 9 ,TC 46/SC 9,. The ISO on-line facility only refers back to 1978.,[11],
,

,An SBN may be converted to an ISBN by prefixing the digit ""0"". For example, the second edition of ,Mr. J. G. Reeder Returns,, published by Hodder in 1965, has ,""SBN 340 01381 8"",, where ""340"" indicates the ,publisher,, ""01381"" is the serial number assigned by the publisher, and ""8"" is the ,check digit,. By prefixing a zero, this can be converted to ,.mw-parser-output cite.citation{font-style:inherit;word-wrap:break-word}.mw-parser-output .citation q{quotes:""\""""""\""""""'""""'""}.mw-parser-output .citation:target{background-color:rgba(0,127,255,0.133)}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-free.id-lock-free a{background:url(""//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Lock-green.svg"")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .id-lock-free a{background-size:contain}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-limited.id-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .id-lock-registration.id-lock-registration a{background:url(""//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Lock-gray-alt-2.svg"")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .id-lock-limited a,body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .id-lock-registration a{background-size:contain}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-subscription.id-lock-subscription a{background:url(""//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/Lock-red-alt-2.svg"")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .id-lock-subscription a{background-size:contain}.mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon a{background:url(""//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg"")right 0.1em center/12px no-repeat}body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon a{background-size:contain}.mw-parser-output .cs1-code{color:inherit;background:inherit;border:none;padding:inherit}.mw-parser-output .cs1-hidden-error{display:none;color:#d33}.mw-parser-output .cs1-visible-error{color:#d33}.mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{display:none;color:#2C882D;margin-left:0.3em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-format{font-size:95%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-left{padding-left:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-right{padding-right:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .citation .mw-selflink{font-weight:inherit}html.skin-theme-clientpref-night .mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{color:#18911F}html.skin-theme-clientpref-night .mw-parser-output .cs1-visible-error,html.skin-theme-clientpref-night .mw-parser-output .cs1-hidden-error{color:#f8a397}@media(prefers-color-scheme:dark){html.skin-theme-clientpref-os .mw-parser-output .cs1-visible-error,html.skin-theme-clientpref-os .mw-parser-output .cs1-hidden-error{color:#f8a397}html.skin-theme-clientpref-os .mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{color:#18911F}},ISBN, ,0-340-01381-8,; the check digit does not need to be re-calculated. Some publishers, such as ,Ballantine Books,, would sometimes use 12-digit SBNs where the last three digits indicated the price of the book;,[12], for example, ,Woodstock Handmade Houses, had a 12-digit Standard Book Number of 345-24223-8-595 (valid SBN: 345-24223-8, ISBN: 0-345-24223-8),,[13], and it cost ,US$5.95,.,[14],
,Since 1 January 2007, ISBNs have contained thirteen digits, a format that is compatible with "",Bookland,"" ,European Article Numbers,, which have 13 digits.,[3],
,The ,United-States,, with 3.9 million registered ISBNs in 2020, was by far the biggest user of the ISBN identifier in 2020, followed by the ,Republic of Korea, (329,582), ,Germany, (284,000), ,China, (263,066), the ,UK, (188,553) and ,Indonesia, (144,793). Lifetime ISBNs registered in the United States are over 39 million as of 2020.,[15],
,
,Overview,
,A separate ISBN is assigned to each edition and variation (except reprintings) of a publication. For example, an ebook, ,audiobook,, paperback, and hardcover edition of the same book must each have a different ISBN assigned to it.,[16],: 12 , The ISBN is thirteen digits long if assigned on or after 1 January 2007, and ten digits long if assigned before 2007.,[c],[3], An International Standard Book Number consists of four parts (if it is a 10-digit ISBN) or five parts (for a 13-digit ISBN).
,Section 5 of the International ISBN Agency's official user manual,[16],: 11 , describes the structure of the 13-digit ISBN, as follows:
,
,The parts of a 10-digit ISBN and the corresponding EAN‑13 and barcode. Note the different check digits in each. The part of the EAN‑13 labeled ""EAN"" is the ,Bookland, country code.,
,for a 13-digit ISBN, a prefix element – a ,GS1, prefix,: so far 978 or 979 have been made available by GS1,,
,the ,registration group element, (language-sharing country group, individual country or territory),,[d],
,the ,registrant, element,,
,the ,publication element,, and,
,a ,checksum, character, or ,check digit,.,
,A 13-digit ISBN can be separated into its parts (,prefix element,, ,registration group,, ,registrant,, ,publication, and ,check digit,), and when this is done it is customary to separate the parts with ,hyphens, or spaces. Separating the parts (,registration group,, ,registrant,, ,publication, and ,check digit,) of a 10-digit ISBN is also done with either hyphens or spaces. Figuring out how to correctly separate a given ISBN is complicated, because most of the parts do not use a fixed number of digits.,[e],
,
,Issuing process ,
,ISBN issuance is country-specific, in that ISBNs are issued by the ISBN registration agency that is responsible for that country or territory regardless of the publication language. The ranges of ISBNs assigned to any particular country are based on the publishing profile of the country concerned, and so the ranges will vary depending on the number of books and the number, type, and size of publishers that are active. Some ISBN registration agencies are based in national libraries or within ministries of culture and thus may receive direct funding from the government to support their services. In other cases, the ISBN registration service is provided by organisations such as bibliographic data providers that are not government funded.,[18],

,Registration group element,
,
,
The ISBN ,registration group element, is a 1-to-5-digit number that is valid within a single prefix element (i.e. one of 978 or 979),,[16],: 11 , and can be separated between hyphens, such as ,""978-1-..."",. Registration groups have primarily been allocated within the 978 prefix element.,[38], The single-digit registration groups within the 978-prefix element are: 0 or 1 for English-speaking countries; 2 for French-speaking countries; 3 for German-speaking countries; 4 for Japan; 5 for Russian-speaking countries; and 7 for People's Republic of China. Example 5-digit registration groups are 99936 and 99980, for Bhutan. The allocated registration groups are: 0–5, 600–631, 65, 7, 80–94, 950–989, 9910–9989, and 99901–99993.,[39], Books published in rare languages typically have longer group elements.,[40],
,Within the 979 prefix element, the registration group 0 is reserved for compatibility with ,International Standard Music Numbers, (ISMNs), but such material is not actually assigned an ISBN.,[41], The registration groups within prefix element 979 that have been assigned are 8 for the United States of America, 10 for France, 11 for the Republic of Korea, and 12 for Italy.,[42],
,The original 9-digit standard book number (SBN) had no registration group identifier, but prefixing a zero to a 9-digit SBN creates a valid 10-digit ISBN.
,
,Registrant element,
,The national ISBN agency assigns the registrant element (,cf., ,Category:ISBN agencies,) and an accompanying series of ISBNs within that registrant element to the publisher; the publisher then allocates one of the ISBNs to each of its books. In most countries, a book publisher is not legally required to assign an ISBN, although most large bookstores only handle publications that have ISBNs assigned to them.,[43],[44],[45],
,The International ISBN Agency maintains the details of over one million ISBN prefixes and publishers in the ,Global Register of Publishers,.,[46], This database is freely searchable over the internet.
,Publishers receive blocks of ISBNs, with larger blocks allotted to publishers expecting to need them; a small publisher may receive ISBNs of one or more digits for the registration group identifier, several digits for the registrant, and a single digit for the publication element. Once that block of ISBNs is used, the publisher may receive another block of ISBNs, with a different registrant element. Consequently, a publisher may have different allotted registrant elements. There also may be more than one registration group identifier used in a country. This might occur once all the registrant elements from a particular registration group have been allocated to publishers.
,By using variable block lengths, registration agencies are able to customise the allocations of ISBNs that they make to publishers. For example, a large publisher may be given a block of ISBNs where fewer digits are allocated for the registrant element and many digits are allocated for the publication element; likewise, countries publishing many titles have few allocated digits for the registration group identifier and many for the registrant and publication elements.,[47], Here are some sample ISBN-10 codes, illustrating block length variations.

,English language pattern ,
,English-language registration group elements are 0 and 1 (2 of more than 220 registration group elements). These two registration group elements are divided into registrant elements in a systematic pattern, which allows their length to be determined, as follows:,[17],

,Check digits,
,A ,check digit, is a form of redundancy check used for ,error detection,, the decimal equivalent of a binary ,check bit,. It consists of a single digit computed from the other digits in the number. The method for the 10-digit ISBN is an extension of that for SBNs, so the two systems are compatible; an SBN prefixed with a zero (the 10-digit ISBN) will give the same check digit as the SBN without the zero. The check digit is base eleven, and can be an integer between 0 and 9, or an 'X'. The system for 13-digit ISBNs is not compatible with SBNs and will, in general, give a different check digit from the corresponding 10-digit ISBN, so does not provide the same protection against transposition. This is because the 13-digit code was required to be compatible with the ,EAN, format, and hence could not contain the letter 'X'.
,
,ISBN-10 check digits,
,According to the 2001 edition of the International ISBN Agency's official user manual,,[48], the ISBN-10 check digit (which is the last digit of the 10-digit ISBN) must range from 0 to 10 (the symbol 'X' is used for 10), and must be such that the sum of the ten digits, each multiplied by its (integer) weight, descending from 10 to 1, is a multiple of 11. That is, if ,x,i, is the ,i,th digit, then ,x,10, must be chosen such that:

,The two most common errors in handling an ISBN (e.g. when typing it or writing it down) are a single altered digit or the transposition of adjacent digits. It can be proven mathematically that all pairs of valid ISBN-10s differ in at least two digits. It can also be proven that there are no pairs of valid ISBN-10s with eight identical digits and two transposed digits. (These proofs are true because the ISBN is less than eleven digits long and because 11 is a ,prime number,.) The ISBN check digit method therefore ensures that it will always be possible to detect these two most common types of error, i.e., if either of these types of error has occurred, the result will never be a valid ISBN – the sum of the digits multiplied by their weights will never be a multiple of 11. However, if the error were to occur in the publishing house and remain undetected, the book would be issued with an invalid ISBN.,[49],
,In contrast, it is possible for other types of error, such as two altered non-transposed digits, or three altered digits, to result in a valid ISBN (although it is still unlikely).
,
,ISBN-10 check digit calculation,
,Each of the first nine digits of the 10-digit ISBN – excluding the check digit itself – is multiplied by its (integer) weight, descending from 10 to 2, and the sum of these nine products found. The value of the check digit is simply the one number between 0 and 10 which, when added to this sum, means the total is a multiple of 11.
,For example, the check digit for an ISBN-10 of 0-306-40615-,?, is calculated as follows:

,Adding 2 to 130 gives a multiple of 11 (because 132 = 12×11) – this is the only number between 0 and 10 which does so. Therefore, the check digit has to be 2, and the complete sequence is ISBN 0-306-40615-2. If the value of ,

,Alternatively, ,modular arithmetic, is convenient for calculating the check digit using modulus 11. The ,remainder, of this sum when it is divided by 11 (i.e. its value modulo 11), is computed. This remainder plus the check digit must equal either 0 or 11. Therefore, the check digit is (11 minus the remainder of the sum of the products modulo 11) modulo 11. Taking the remainder modulo 11 a second time accounts for the possibility that the first remainder is 0. Without the second modulo operation, the calculation could result in a check digit value of ,11 − 0 = 11,, which is invalid. (Strictly speaking, the ,first, ""modulo 11"" is not needed, but it may be considered to simplify the calculation.)

,Thus the check digit is 2.
,It is possible to avoid the multiplications in a software implementation by using two accumulators. Repeatedly adding ,t, into ,s, computes the necessary multiples:
,
,// Returns ISBN error syndrome, zero for a valid ISBN, non-zero for an invalid one.,
,// digits[i] must be between 0 and 10.,
,int, ,CheckISBN,(,int, ,const, ,digits,[,10,]), ,{,
,  ,int, ,i,,, ,s, ,=, ,0,,, ,t, ,=, ,0,;,

,  ,for, ,(,i, ,=, ,0,;, ,i, ,<, ,10,;, ,++,i,), ,{,
,    ,t, ,+=, ,digits,[,i,];,
,    ,s, ,+=, ,t,;,
,  ,},
,  ,return, ,s, ,%, ,11,;,
,},
,
,The modular reduction can be done once at the end, as shown above (in which case ,s, could hold a value as large as 496, for the invalid ISBN 99999-999-9-X), or ,s, and ,t, could be reduced by a conditional subtract after each addition.

,ISBN-13 check digit calculation,
,Appendix 1 of the International ISBN Agency's official user manual,[16],: 33 , describes how the 13-digit ISBN check digit is calculated. The ISBN-13 check digit, which is the last digit of the ISBN, must range from 0 to 9 and must be such that the sum of all the thirteen digits, each multiplied by its (integer) weight, alternating between 1 and 3, is a multiple of ,10,. As ISBN-13 is a subset of ,EAN-13,, the algorithm for calculating the check digit is exactly the same for both.
,Formally, using ,modular arithmetic,, this is rendered:

,The calculation of an ISBN-13 check digit begins with the first twelve digits of the 13-digit ISBN (thus excluding the check digit itself). Each digit, from left to right, is alternately multiplied by 1 or 3, then those products are summed ,modulo, 10 to give a value ranging from 0 to 9. Subtracted from 10, that leaves a result from 1 to 10. A zero replaces a ten, so, in all cases, a single check digit results.
,For example, the ISBN-13 check digit of 978-0-306-40615-,?, is calculated as follows:
,
,s = 9×1 + 7×3 + 8×1 + 0×3 + 3×1 + 0×3 + 6×1 + 4×3 + 0×1 + 6×3 + 1×1 + 5×3
  =   9 +  21 +   8 +   0 +   3 +   0 +   6 +  12 +   0 +  18 +   1 +  15
  = 93
93 / 10 = 9 remainder 3
10 –  3 = 7
,
,Thus, the check digit is 7, and the complete sequence is ISBN 978-0-306-40615-7.
,In general, the ISBN check digit is calculated as follows.

,This check system – similar to the ,UPC, check digit formula – does not catch all errors of adjacent digit transposition. Specifically, if the difference between two adjacent digits is 5, the check digit will not catch their transposition. For instance, the above example allows this situation with the 6 followed by a 1. The correct order contributes ,3 × 6 + 1 × 1 = 19, to the sum; while, if the digits are transposed (1 followed by a 6), the contribution of those two digits will be ,3 × 1 + 1 × 6 = 9,. However, 19 and 9 are congruent modulo 10, and so produce the same, final result: both ISBNs will have a check digit of 7. The ISBN-10 formula uses the ,prime, modulus 11 which avoids this blind spot, but requires more than the digits 0–9 to express the check digit.
,Additionally, if the sum of the 2nd, 4th, 6th, 8th, 10th, and 12th digits is tripled then added to the remaining digits (1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th, 11th, and 13th), the total will always be divisible by 10 (i.e., end in 0).
,
,ISBN-10 to ISBN-13 conversion,
,A 10-digit ISBN is converted to a 13-digit ISBN by prepending ""978"" to the  ISBN-10 and recalculating the final checksum digit using the ISBN-13 algorithm. The reverse process can also be performed, but not for numbers commencing with a prefix other than 978, which have no 10-digit equivalent.
,
,Errors in usage,
,Publishers, and ,libraries, have varied policies about the use of the ISBN check digit. Publishers sometimes fail to check the correspondence of a book title and its ISBN before publishing it; that failure causes book identification problems for libraries, booksellers, and readers.,[50], For example, ,ISBN, ,0-590-76484-5, is shared by two books – ,Ninja gaiden: a novel based on the best-selling game by Tecmo, (1990) and ,Wacky laws, (1997), both published by ,Scholastic,.
,Most libraries and booksellers display the book record for an invalid ISBN issued by the publisher. The ,Library of Congress, catalogue contains books published with invalid ISBNs, which it usually tags with the phrase ""Cancelled ISBN"".,[51], The International Union Library Catalog (a.k.a., ,WorldCat, ,OCLC, – Online Computer Library Center system) often indexes by invalid ISBNs, if the book is indexed in that way by a member library.,[52],

,Only the term ""ISBN"" should be used; the terms ""eISBN"" and ""e-ISBN"" have historically been sources of confusion and should be avoided. If a book exists in one or more digital (,e-book,) formats, each of those formats must have its own ISBN. In other words, each of the three separate ,EPUB,, ,Amazon Kindle,, and ,PDF, formats of a particular book will have its own specific ISBN. They should not share the ISBN of the paper version, and there is no generic ""eISBN"" which encompasses all the e-book formats for a title.,[53],
,
,EAN format used in barcodes, and upgrading,
,The ,barcodes, on a book's back cover (or inside a mass-market ,paperback, book's front cover) are ,EAN-13,; they may have a separate barcode encoding five digits called an ,EAN-5, for the ,currency, and the ,recommended retail price,.,[54], For 10-digit ISBNs, the number ""978"", the ,Bookland, ""country code"", is prefixed to the ISBN in the barcode data, and the check digit is recalculated according to the EAN-13 formula (modulo 10, 1× and 3× weighting on alternating digits).
,Partly because of an expected shortage in certain ISBN categories, the ,International Organization for Standardization, (ISO) decided to migrate to a 13-digit ISBN (ISBN-13). The process began on 1 January 2005 and was planned to conclude on 1 January 2007.,[55], As of 2011,[update],, all the 13-digit ISBNs began with 978. As the 978 ISBN supply is exhausted, the 979 prefix was introduced. Part of the 979 prefix is reserved for use with the ,Musicland, code for musical scores with an ,ISMN,. The 10-digit ISMN codes differed visually as they began with an ""M"" letter; the bar code represents the ""M"" as a zero, and for checksum purposes it counted as a 3. All ISMNs are now thirteen digits commencing 979-0; 979-1 to 979-9 will be used by ISBN.
,Publisher identification code numbers are unlikely to be the same in the 978 and 979 ISBNs, likewise, there is no guarantee that language area code numbers will be the same. Moreover, the 10-digit ISBN check digit generally is not the same as the 13-digit ISBN check digit. Because the GTIN-13 is part of the ,Global Trade Item Number, (GTIN) system (that includes the GTIN-14, the GTIN-12, and the GTIN-8), the 13-digit ISBN falls within the 14-digit data field range.,[56],
,Barcode format compatibility is maintained, because (aside from the group breaks) the ISBN-13 barcode format is identical to the EAN barcode format of existing 10-digit ISBNs. So, migration to an EAN-based system allows booksellers the use of a single numbering system for both books and non-book products that is compatible with existing ISBN based data, with only minimal changes to ,information technology, systems. Hence, many ,booksellers, (e.g., ,Barnes & Noble,) migrated to EAN barcodes as early as March 2005. Although many American and Canadian booksellers were able to read EAN-13 barcodes before 2005, most general retailers could not read them. The upgrading of the ,UPC, ,barcode system, to full EAN-13, in 2005, eased migration to the ISBN in North America.

,^, ,Occasionally, publishers erroneously assign an ISBN to more than one title – the first edition of ,The Ultimate Alphabet, and ,The Ultimate Alphabet Workbook, have the same ISBN, 0-8050-0076-3. Conversely, the same book can be published with several ISBNs: A German second-language edition of ,Emil und die Detektive, has the ISBNs 87-23-90157-8 (Denmark), 0-8219-1069-8 (United States), 91-21-15628-X (Sweden), 0-85048-548-7 (United Kingdom) and 3-12-675495-3 (Germany).,
,
,^, ,In some cases, books sold only as a set share the same ISBN. For example, the ,Vance Integral Edition, used only two ISBNs for 44 books.,
,
,^ ,a, ,b, ,Publishers were required to convert existing ISBNs from the 10-digit format to the 13-digit format (in their publication records) by 1 January 2007. For ,existing, publications, the new 13-digit ISBN would only need to be added if (and when) a publication was reprinted. During the transition period, publishers were recommended to print ,both, the 10-digit and 13-digit ISBNs on the verso of a publication's title page, but they were required to print ,only, the 13-digit ISBN after 1 January 2007.,[3],
,
,^, ,Some books have several codes in the first block: e.g. A. M. Yaglom's ,Correlation Theory...,, published by ,Springer Verlag,, has two ISBNs, ,0-387-96331-6, and ,3-540-96331-6,. Though Springer's 387 and 540 codes are different for English (0) and German (3); the same item number 96331 produces the same check digit for both (6). Springer uses 431 as the publisher code for Japanese (4), and 4-431-96331-? also has a check digit of 6. Other Springer books in English have publisher code 817, and 0-817-96331-? would also have a check digit of 6. This suggests that special considerations were made for assigning Springer's publisher codes, as random assignments of different publisher codes would not be expected to lead by coincidence to the same check digit every time for the same item number. Finding publisher codes for English and German, say, with this effect would amount to solving a linear equation in modular arithmetic.,[,original research?,],
,
,^, ,The International ISBN Agency's ,ISBN User's Manual, says: ""The ten-digit number is divided into four parts of variable length, which must be separated clearly, by hyphens or spaces"", although omission of separators is permitted for internal data processing. If present, hyphens must be correctly placed.,[17], The actual definition for hyphenation contains more than 220 different registration group elements with each one broken down into a few to several ranges for the length of the registrant element (more than 1,000 total). The document defining the ranges, listed by agency, is 29 pages.,

 Esta página se editó por última vez el 14 feb 2024 a las 07:49.,"Guido van Rossum - PyCon 2013,
,Benevolent Dictator for Life, (BDFL) es un título informal que se otorga a ciertos ,individuos, de la ,comunidad, de ,desarrolladores, de software de ,código abierto, que tienen la tarea de asignar las directrices generales y, en ciertas ,situaciones,, las decisiones finales dentro del ámbito de un ,proyecto,. La traducción de ,Benevolent Dictator for Life, es ,Dictador Benevolente De por vida,, lo que conlleva un tanto de informalidad y ,humor,.
,En 1995 ,Guido van Rossum,, creador de ,Python,, fue la primera persona sobre la que recayó dicha distinción.,[,1,],​,[,2,],​
,El término ""Benevolent Dictator for Life"" fue acuñado por el programador de Python, ,Guido van Rossum,, quien se autodesignó como ""BDFL"" para el desarrollo de ,Python,. En la comunidad del ,software libre,, el papel del BDFL es visto como una forma efectiva de tomar ,decisiones, rápidas y unificadas, lo que permite que un ,proyecto, crezca y evolucione de manera más ,eficiente,.
,Sin embargo, también hay críticas al ,concepto, de BDFL, ya que algunas personas argumentan que el control absoluto de una sola persona puede limitar la ,creatividad, y la ,innovación, del proyecto. Además, la ,naturaleza, del BDFL puede crear una ,dependencia, insalubre en una sola ,persona,, lo que puede ser perjudicial para el ,proyecto, a ,largo, ,plazo,.
,Nótese la diferencia con su significado histórico usado en un contexto ,político,.,[,cita requerida,],

,Entendemos por dictador benevolente aquella persona que tiene la autoridad final para la toma de decisiones, por su personalidad o experiencia y la aplica diariamente con un uso racional para el beneficio de una comunidad o de una familia en concreto.
,No hay que asociar este concepto al tópico de dictador que toma las decisiones por la fuerza o sin consenso común. Los dictadores benevolentes no toman realmente las decisiones, dejan que las cosas fluyan libremente, esperan un intercambio de ideas, y mediante la experiencia, el razonamiento y la reflexión intentan llegar a un acuerdo. En caso de que no se consiga, el dictador benevolente cuenta con suficiente experiencia para poder tomar una decisión final que beneficiará a la sociedad.,[,16,],​ 
,Por otro lado, en muchos casos el dictador tendrá que delegar responsabilidad en la toma de decisiones en quien considere que esté capacitado para ejecutarlo.  
,Una de las características que les une a los dictadores, es su rechazo en la toma de decisiones sin ser consensuada y entendida por todos los miembros de la sociedad, a lo que suelen decir “así tiene que ser”, en el sentido de que es lo mejor para ti y para la sociedad porque ya lo he conocido a través de la experiencia. 
,Ser dictador benevolente requiere una especial delicadeza a la hora de dirigirse a la comunidad. En primer lugar, cuando comienza la conversación, el dictador permite que los individuos de la sociedad manifiesten sus opiniones libremente, dejando para el final sus opiniones constructivas para que los miembros de la comunidad no se sientan influenciados. Aunque en algunos casos, el dictador puede equivocarse, pero no por ello pierde su credibilidad. 
,Es importante que el dictador sea el emprendedor del proyecto. Que reúna las habilidades, tales como competencia técnica o habilidad de persuadir para poder liderar el proyecto y que los miembros de la sociedad confíen en tus ideas. Así el proyecto será centralizado ya que sus conocimientos y aptitudes son aceptadas por el grupo. Pero en cambio si no hay un candidato con suficiente credibilidad, es mejor que el proyecto se descentralice en la toma de decisiones.

Its leaders established a foundation to support the language—Python’s inventor, Guido van Rossum, had even just moved from the Netherlands to the United States to help the project. So as the foundation established itself—at that point, it and the community were synonymous—it appointed van Rossum the final arbiter of all developmental conflict. He was the first First-Interim Benevolent Dictator For Life.», ,

Going forward, volunteer programmers (usually) must make all the decisions about which features should be added, which should be cut, and when all that should happen. (...) But what happens if a consensus doesn’t form? What if a problem is intractable? The two teams could split, each forking the project and going their own ways. But even then, who keeps the spoils and the name of the project? Some open-source communities, therefore, have entrusted the power to make decisions in one or two people. These people get, to first approximation, the absolute raddest titles in technology. They are the Benevolent Dictators for Life.», ,

,In 2007, Canonical launched an International online shop selling support services and Ubuntu-branded goods; later in 2008 it expanded that with a United States-specific shop designed to reduce shipment times.,[19], At the same time, the word ,Ubuntu, was trademarked in connection with clothing and accessories.,[20],
,In a ,Guardian, interview in May 2008, Shuttleworth said that Canonical's ,business model, was service provision and that Canonical was not yet close to profitability. Canonical stated that it would wait three to five years to become profitable. Shuttleworth regarded Canonical as positioning itself as demand for services related to free software rose. This strategy has been compared to ,Red Hat,'s business strategies in the 1990s.,[21], In an early-2009 ,New York Times, article, Shuttleworth said that Canonical's revenue was ""creeping"" towards ,US$,30 million,, the company's break-even point.,[22],
,Canonical achieved a small operating profit of $281,000 in 2009, but until 2017 struggled to maintain financial solvency and took a major financial hit from the development of ,Unity, and ,Ubuntu Touch,, leading to an operating loss of $21.6 million for the fiscal year 2013.,[23], The company reported an operating profit of $2 million in 2017 after shutting down the Unity development team and laying off nearly 200 employees. The company now plans to focus on its server and professional support solutions,,[,buzzword,], which have proved to be most profitable. Through this, Canonical plans to maintain solvency and achieve long-term profitability.,[24],[25], In 2022, Ubuntu made a profit of £0.52m on revenues of £14.31m. ,[26],
,Canonical reported a revenue of $175M in 2021. ,[27],

 آخر تعديل لهذه الصفحة كان يوم 29 أغسطس 2023، الساعة 22:42.,"الديكتاتور الخيري مدى الحياة, (,BDFL,) هو عنوان يُعطى لعدد صغير من قادة تطوير البرمجيات مفتوحة المصدر، وعادة ما يكون مؤسسو المشروع الذين يحتفظون ,بالقرار, النهائي في النزاعات أو النقاشات داخل المجتمع. نشأت العبارة عام 1995 بالإشارة إلى ,جايدو ڤان روسم,، مبتكر ,لغة برمجة بايثون,.,[1],[2],
,
,
,أصل المصطلح,[,عدل,],
,بعد فترة وجيزة من انضمام فان روسوم إلى مؤسسة المبادرات البحثية الوطنية، ظهر المصطلح في رسالة متابعة من طرف كين مانهايمر إلى اجتماع يحاول إنشاء مجموعة شبه رسمية تشرف على تطوير بايثون وورش العمل؛ تضمن هذا الاستخدام الأولي نكتة إضافية لتسمية فان روسوم «أول ديكتاتور خيري مؤقت مدى الحياة». أعلن فان روسوم في 12 يوليو 2018، أنه سيتنحى عن منصبه كديكتاتور خيري مدى الحياة في بايثون.
,
,عبارات مشابهة,[,عدل,],
,لا ينبغي الخلط بينه وبين مصطلح أكثر شيوعا لقادة مفتوحة المصدر، «دكتاتور خيري»، الذي انتشر شعبياً من قبل ,إريك ريموند, مقال الصورة "" Homesteading the Noosphere "".,[3], من بين الموضوعات الأخرى المتعلقة ,ثقافة الهاكر,، يوضح ريمون كيف أن طبيعة المصدر المفتوح تجبر «الديكتاتورية» على إبقاء نفسها خيرة، لأن الخلاف الشديد يمكن أن يؤدي إلى ,انشقاق, المشروع تحت حكم قادة جدد.

 این صفحه آخرین‌بار در ‏۸ مارس ۲۰۲۴ ساعت ‏۱۶:۴۰ ویرایش شده است.,"دیکتاتور خیرخواه جاویدان, (به ,انگلیسی,: ,Benevolent dictator for life,) یا به اختصار BDFL، عنوانی است که به تعداد کمی از رهبران پروژه‌های نرم‌افزاری ,آزاد و متن‌باز, گفته می‌شود. این عنوان معمولاً به رهبر پروژه‌هایی گفته می‌شود که خود بنیان‌گذار پروژه بوده‌اند و در مباحثات و اختلاف‌ها حرف نهایی را می‌زنند. کاربران و توسعه‌دهندگان پروژه به این رهبر آنقدر اعتماد دارند که او نمی‌تواند از قدرتش سوءاستفاده کند. این لقب اولین بار در سال ۱۹۹۵ در اشاره به ,خودو فان روسوم,، خالق ,زبان برنامه‌نویسی پایتون, استفاده شد. کمی پس از اینکه فان روسوم به ,CNRI, پیوست، این اصطلاح در یک ایمیلی از طرف ,کن منهیمر, در مورد دیداری برای تشکیل دادن یک گروه نیمه‌رسمی جهت نظارت بر روی توسعه زبان پایتون، مورد استفاده قرار گرفته بود.
,BDFL را نباید با اصطلاح رایج‌تر ,دیکتاتوری خیرخواه, که در مورد رهبران پروژه‌های متن‌باز مورد استفاده قرار می‌گیرد، اشتباه گرفت، که این اصطلاح توسط ,اریک ریموند, به محبوبیت رسید. ریموند شرح می‌دهد که چگونه طبیعت و سرشت متن‌باز، دیکتاتور پروژه را مجبور می‌کنند تا «خیرخواه» باشد، چرا که وجود یک اختلاف عمده در پروژه، ممکن است باعث شود تا پروژه تحت حکومت رهبران ناراضی، ,منشعب, شود.

,PyTorch Lightning, is an open-source ,Python, library that provides a high-level interface for ,PyTorch,, a popular ,deep learning, framework.,[1], It is a lightweight and high-performance framework that organizes PyTorch code to decouple the research from the engineering, making deep learning experiments easier to read and reproduce. It is designed to create scalable deep learning models that can easily run on distributed hardware while keeping the models hardware agnostic.  
,In 2019, Lightning was adopted by the ,NeurIPS, Reproducibility Challenge as a standard for submitting PyTorch code to the conference.,[2],
,In 2022, the PyTorch Lightning library officially became a part of the Lightning framework, an open-source framework managed by the original creators of PyTorch Lightning.

,The foundation is ,chaired, by ,Ton Roosendaal,, the original author of the Blender software. One of the foundation's stated goals is ""to give the worldwide Internet community access to 3D technology in general, with Blender as a core"".,[4],
,The foundation provides various resources to support the community formed around using and developing Blender. In particular, it organizes an annual Blender Conference in ,Amsterdam,[5], to discuss plans for the future of Blender, as well as staffing a booth to represent Blender at ,SIGGRAPH,.,[6],[7], Donations are also used to maintain the Blender website and hire developers to improve the Blender software.,[4],
,
,Contributors,[,edit,],
,The foundation is funded entirely by donations from ,entrepreneurs,, companies, and users.,[8], Many ,video game publishers, such as ,Epic Games,, ,Ubisoft,, ,Activision,, ,Valve,, and ,NetEase, have made contributions. ,Nvidia,, ,Intel,, ,AMD,, ,Meta,, ,Microsoft,, ,Adobe,, and ,Google, have also funded the project.,[9],
,In 2019, Epic Games awarded the Blender Foundation a ,US$,1,200,000 grant as part of their ,Epic MegaGrants, initiative.,[10], Founder and CEO of Epic Games ,Tim Sweeney, stated, ""Open tools, libraries and platforms are critical to the future of the digital content ecosystem"" and that ""Blender is an enduring resource within the artistic community, and we aim to ensure its advancement to the benefit of all creators."",[11],

,The Blender Foundation maintains several community-driven ""Open Projects"" through its affiliated ,Blender Institute, program, including several ,freely licensed, films and a ,free, open-source, video game ,Yo Frankie!, (2008).,[12], According to the Foundation, these projects are intended ""to validate and improve the 3D open source content creation pipeline with Blender"". Each project was created using the Blender software and released under permissive license terms, along with the source material. In addition to demonstrating the capabilities of the software, the Open Projects provided detailed production material (sketches, tutorials, textures and models, etc.) to serve as examples for the Blender user community, as well as finished products that could be widely used for other purposes.,[13],
,On 18 March 2006, the Blender Foundation released its first film, ,Elephants Dream,.,[14], In response to the success of ,Elephants Dream,, the Blender Foundation established the Blender Institute to support future software and content development projects. The Blender Institute operates out of a studio within the ,Entrepotdok, building in Amsterdam, where the Blender Foundation is also located, and is headed by Ton Roosendaal.
,On 10 April 2008, the Blender Institute released its second film, ,Big Buck Bunny,.,[15],[16],[17], Based on the movie, the Blender Institute released its first Open Game project ,Yo Frankie!,, in November 2008.
,On 30 September 2010 the Blender Institute released its third project, ,Sintel,.
,In October 2011, Concept/Script Development began for Blender's fourth open film project titled ,Tears of Steel,. Contrary to previous Blender Institute projects, which were 100% computer graphics, the focus of Tears of Steel was the combination of live action footage with computer generated characters and environments. The live action footage was shot with a high-end ,Sony F65, camera. The project was released on 26 September 2012.,[18],
,The ,Gooseberry Open Movie Project, is the fifth Open Movie Project initiated by the Blender Foundation. Ton Roosendal announced the project in January 2010.,[19],[20], The most ambitious project yet, one of the primary goals is for the Gooseberry Open Movie Project to be the first full-length film produced by the Blender Institute. Work on the film, called ,Cosmos Laundromat,, began in 2014,[21], (although a release date was not yet announced). A ten-minute pilot, entitled ,Cosmos Laundromat: First Cycle, was released on YouTube and Netflix on 10 August 2015,[22], and premiered at the Netherlands Film Festival on 24 September 2015.,[23], The pilot won the Jury's Prize at Animago 2015,,[24], an international conference for 3D animation.
,In 2013, the second episode of a short animated series ,Caminandes, was released under the Blender Foundation umbrella.,[25], In 2016, a third short was released.
,Hero,, the sixth Open Movie Project, was announced in September 2017 and released on 16th April 2018.,[26],[27], The technical target for ,Hero, was to use and improve the Grease Pencil tools.
,Sprite Fright,, a short animated ,comedy-horror, was announced on 9 November 2020,[28], and released on 29 October 2021.,[29],
,Charge, was released the 15 December 2022.,[30],
,Pet Projects, was announced on 19 January 2023.,[31], The official release title is ""WING IT!"" and was released the 12 September 2023.,[32],
,Project Gold, was announced on 22 May 2023.,[33],

,Warm Showers, (WS) is a non-profit ,hospitality exchange service, for people engaging in ,bicycle touring,. The platform is a ,gift economy, — hosts are not supposed to charge for ,lodging, and are not bound.,[2],[3],[4],[5],[6],[7],  The legal form is a Colorado ,501(c)(3), ,nonprofit organization, headquartered in ,Boulder, Colorado,, US.,[8],
,The platform has been described as a ""cyclists’ support network whose members may offer free amenities and services such as meals and lodging"".,[9], ,Rough Guides, recommends Warm Showers as means to improve security of ,solo female cyclists,.,[10], Warm Showers helps bicycle travelers to balance the self-reliance of camping and hotels with opportunities for social encounters.,[11], Warm Showers has a positive effect on rural communities, both socially and economically.,[12], Many users of the platform cycle for health reasons or to reduce their ,carbon footprint, and to be ,environmentally friendly,.,[13],[2], Cultural exchange and social connection do also play a role.,[14],[3],[15],
,The organization received donations of $100,641 in 2015, $84,009 in 2016, $115,324 in 2017, $128,626 in 2018 and $111,089 in 2019.,[8],[16],[17],[18], 
,
,
,History,[,edit,],
,The concept was inspired by cyclist John Mosley in 1976 by placing an ad in the U.S. magazine ,Bike World,, which requested to sign up for a hospitality list.,[14], A list of 800 names and contact infos was put into a ,rolodex, for almost 30 years. The name of the organization was ,Touring Cyclist Hospitality Directory, back then. Mosley provided touring cyclists with copies of pages from the rolodex.
,A Canadian couple, Terry Zmrhal and Geoff Cashmen, founded Warm Showers in 1993 as a continuation of Touring Cyclist Hospitality Directory.,[14],[19],[20], They created a database from the existing members of biking-hospitality organizations. In 1996, Roger Gravel became responsible for the platform.,[21], In 2005, Randy Fay created the website based on the existing database.,[19], 
,As of 2018, Seth Portner was the executive director of Warm Showers.,[18],[8],[17], In 2019, Tahverlee Anglen provided management services.,[16],
,
,Membership statistics,[,edit,],
,Cycle touring over the ,Eriskay, - South Uist causeway,
,In 2018, 53% of members were based in Europe and 30% in North America.,[22],

,
,Homestay requests,[,edit,],
,Warm Showers grants trustworthy teams of scientists access to its ,anonymized data, for publication of insights to the benefit of humanity. In 2015, an analysis of 97,915 ,homestay, requests from ,BeWelcome, and 285,444 homestay requests from Warm Showers showed general regularity — the less time is spent on writing a homestay request, the lower is the probability of success. Since both networks are shaped by ,altruism,, low-effort communication, aka 'copy and paste requests', evidently sends the wrong ,signal,.,[24],

,GitHub, (,/,ˈ,ɡ,ɪ,t,h,ʌ,b,/,[a],) is a developer platform that allows developers to create, store, manage and share their code. It uses ,Git, software, providing the ,distributed version control, of Git plus ,access control,, ,bug tracking,, ,software feature, requests, ,task management,, ,continuous integration,, and ,wikis, for every project.,[7], Headquartered in ,California,, it has been a subsidiary of ,Microsoft, since 2018.,[8],
,It is commonly used to host ,open source, software development projects.,[9], As of January 2023,[update],, GitHub reported having over 100 million developers,[10], and more than 420 million ,repositories,,,[11], including at least 28 million public repositories.,[12], It is the world's largest ,source code, host as of June 2023,[update],.
,
,
,About,[,edit,],
,Founding,[,edit,],
,The development of the GitHub platform began on October 19, 2007.,[13],[14],[15], The site was launched in April 2008 by ,Tom Preston-Werner,, ,Chris Wanstrath,, ,P. J. Hyett, and Scott Chacon after it had been available for a few months as a ,beta release,.,[16], GitHub has an annual ,keynote, called GitHub Universe.,[17],
,
,Structure of the organization,[,edit,],
,GitHub, Inc. was originally a ,flat organization, with no middle managers; in other words, ""everyone is a manager"" (,self-management,).,[18], Employees could choose to work on projects that interested them (,open allocation,), but the chief executive set salaries. (i.e. Individual or groups of company executive leaders decides on project aims and development, including funding),[19],
,In 2014, GitHub, Inc. added a layer of ,middle management, in response to serious harassment allegations against its senior leadership. As a result of the scandal, ,Tom Preston-Werner, resigned from his position as CEO.,[20],
,
,Finance,[,edit,],
,GitHub was a ,bootstrapped, ,start-up business,, which in its first years provided enough revenue to be funded solely by its three founders and start taking on employees.,[21],
,In July 2012, four years after the company was founded, ,Andreessen Horowitz, invested $100 million in ,venture capital,[7], with a $750 million valuation.,[22],
,In July 2015 GitHub raised another $250 million (~$314 million in 2023) of venture capital in a ,series B round,. The lead investor was ,Sequoia Capital,, and other investors were ,Andreessen Horowitz,, ,Thrive Capital,, IVP (Institutional Venture Partners) and other venture capital funds.,[23],[24], The round valued the company at approximately $2 billion.,[25],
,As of 2023,,[update], GitHub was estimated to generate $1 billion in revenue.,[2],
,
,History,[,edit,],
The GitHub service was developed by ,Chris Wanstrath,, ,P. J. Hyett,, ,Tom Preston-Werner,, and Scott Chacon using ,Ruby on Rails,, and started in February 2008. The company, GitHub, Inc., has existed as of 2007,[update], and is located in San Francisco.,[26],GitHub at AWS Summit,
,The shading of the map illustrates the number of users as a proportion of each country's ,Internet population,. The circular charts surrounding the two hemispheres depict the total number of GitHub users (left) and commits (right) per country.,
,On February 24, 2009, GitHub announced that within the first year of being online, GitHub had accumulated over 46,000 public repositories, 17,000 of which were formed in the previous month. At that time, about 6,200 repositories had been ,forked, at least once, and 4,600 had been merged.
,That same year, the site was used by over 100,000 users, according to GitHub,,[27], and had grown to host 90,000 unique public repositories, 12,000 having been forked at least once, for a total of 135,000 repositories.,[28],
,In 2010, GitHub was hosting 1 million repositories.,[29], A year later, this number doubled.,[30], ,ReadWriteWeb, reported that GitHub had surpassed ,SourceForge, and ,Google Code, in total number of commits for the period of January to May 2011.,[31], On January 16, 2013, GitHub passed the 3 million users mark and was then hosting more than 5 million repositories.,[32], By the end of the year, the number of repositories was twice as great, reaching 10 million repositories.,[33],
,In 2015, GitHub opened an office in Japan, its first outside of the U.S.,[34], In 2016, GitHub was ranked No. 14 on the ,Forbes, Cloud 100 list.,[35], It was not featured on 2018, 2019, and 2020 lists.,[36],
,On February 28, 2018, GitHub fell victim to the third-largest ,distributed denial-of-service, (DDoS) attack in history, with incoming traffic reaching a peak of about 1.35 terabits per second.,[37],
,On June 19, 2018, GitHub expanded its GitHub Education by offering free education bundles to all schools.,[38],[39],
,
,Acquisition by Microsoft,[,edit,],
,Microsoft was on top of the list of the ten organizations with the most open-source contributors on GitHub in 2016.,[40],
,From 2012, ,Microsoft, became a significant user of GitHub, using it to host open-source projects and development tools such as ,.NET Core,, ,Chakra Core,, ,MSBuild,, ,PowerShell,, ,PowerToys,, ,Visual Studio Code,, ,Windows Calculator,, ,Windows Terminal, and the bulk of its product documentation (now to be found on ,Microsoft Docs,).,[41],[42],
,On June 4, 2018, Microsoft announced its intent to acquire GitHub for US$7.5 billion (~$8.96 billion in 2023). The deal closed on October 26, 2018.,[43], GitHub continued to operate independently as a community, platform and business.,[44], Under Microsoft, the service was led by ,Xamarin,'s ,Nat Friedman,, reporting to ,Scott Guthrie,, executive vice president of Microsoft Cloud and AI. ,Nat Friedman, resigned November 3, 2021; he was replaced by Thomas Dohmke.,[45],
,There have been concerns from developers Kyle Simpson, ,JavaScript, trainer and author, and Rafael Laguna, CEO at ,Open-Xchange, over Microsoft's purchase, citing uneasiness over Microsoft's handling of previous acquisitions, such as ,Nokia's mobile business, and ,Skype,.,[46],[47],
,This acquisition was in line with Microsoft's business strategy under CEO ,Satya Nadella,, which has seen a larger focus on ,cloud computing, services, alongside the development of and contributions to open-source software.,[8],[42],[48], ,Harvard Business Review, argued that Microsoft was intending to acquire GitHub to get access to its user base, so it can be used as a ,loss leader, to encourage the use of its other development products and services.,[49],
,Concerns over the sale bolstered interest in competitors: ,Bitbucket, (owned by ,Atlassian,), ,GitLab, and ,SourceForge, (owned by BIZX, LLC) reported that they had seen spikes in new users intending to migrate projects from GitHub to their respective services.,[50],[51],[52],[53],[54],
,In September 2019, GitHub acquired ,Semmle,, a code analysis tool.,[55], In February 2020, GitHub launched in India under the name GitHub India Private Limited.,[56], In March 2020, GitHub announced that they were acquiring ,npm,, a JavaScript packaging vendor, for an undisclosed sum of money.,[57], The deal was closed on April 15, 2020.,[58],
,In early July 2020, the GitHub Archive Program was established to archive its open-source code in perpetuity.,[59],
,
,Mascot,[,edit,],
,GitHub's ,mascot, is an ,anthropomorphized, ""octocat"" with five ,octopus-like arms,.,[60],[61], The character was created by graphic designer ,Simon Oxley, as ,clip art, to sell on ,iStock,,,[62], a website that enables designers to market ,royalty-free, ,digital images,. The illustration GitHub chose was a character that Oxley had named Octopuss.,[62], Since GitHub wanted Octopuss for their logo (a use that the iStock license disallows), they negotiated with Oxley to buy exclusive rights to the image.,[62],
,GitHub renamed Octopuss to Octocat,,[62], and trademarked the character along with the new name.,[60], Later, GitHub hired illustrator Cameron McEfee to adapt Octocat for different purposes on the website and promotional materials; McEfee and various GitHub users have since created hundreds of variations of the character, which are available on ,The Octodex,.,[63],[64],
,
,Services,[,edit,],
,Projects on GitHub can be accessed and managed using the standard ,Git, command-line interface; all standard Git commands work with it. GitHub also allows users to browse public ,repositories, on the site. Multiple desktop clients and Git ,plugins, are also available. In addition, the site provides ,social networking,-like functions such as feeds, followers, wikis (using ,wiki software, called ,Gollum,), and a ,social network graph, to display how developers work on their versions ("",forks,"") of a repository and what fork (and branch within that fork) is newest.
,Anyone can browse and download public repositories, but only registered users can contribute content to repositories. With a registered user account, users can have discussions, manage repositories, submit contributions to others' repositories, and ,review changes to code,. GitHub began offering limited private repositories at no cost in January 2019 (limited to three contributors per project). Previously, only public repositories were free.,[65],[66],[67], On April 14, 2020, GitHub made ""all of the core GitHub features"" free for everyone, including ""private repositories with unlimited collaborators."",[68],
,The fundamental software that underpins GitHub is ,Git, itself, written by ,Linus Torvalds,, creator of Linux. The additional software that provides the GitHub user interface was written using ,Ruby on Rails, and ,Erlang, by GitHub, Inc. developers Wanstrath,,[69], Hyett, and Preston-Werner.
,
,Scope,[,edit,],
,The primary purpose of GitHub is to facilitate the ,version control, and ,issue tracking, aspects of software development. Labels, milestones, responsibility assignment, and a search engine are available for issue tracking. For version control, Git (and, by extension, GitHub) allows ,pull requests, to propose changes to the source code. Users who can review the proposed changes can see a diff between the requested changes and approve them. In Git terminology, this action is called ""committing"" and one instance of it is a ""commit."" A history of all commits is kept and can be viewed at a later time.
,In addition, GitHub supports the following formats and features:
,
,Documentation,,[70], including automatically rendered ,README, files in a variety of ,Markdown,-like file formats (see ,README § On GitHub,),
,Wikis,,,[71], with some repositories consisting solely of wiki content. These include curated lists of recommended software which have become known as awesome lists.,[72],[73],
,GitHub Actions,,[74], which allows building ,continuous integration, and ,continuous deployment, pipelines for testing, releasing and deploying software without the use of third-party websites/platforms,
,GitHub Codespaces, an ,online IDE, providing users with a virtual machine intended to be a work environment to build and test code,[75],[76],[77],
,Graphs: pulse, contributors, commits, code frequency, punch card, network, members,
,Integrations Directory,[78],
,Email notifications,[79],
,Discussions,[80],
,Option to subscribe someone to notifications by ,@ mentioning, them.,[81],
,Emojis,[82],
,Nested ,task-lists, within files,
,Visualization of ,geospatial, data,
,3D render files can be previewed using an integrated STL file viewer that displays the files on a ""3D canvas."",[83], The viewer is powered by ,WebGL, and ,Three.js,.,
,Support for previewing many common image formats, including Photoshop's PSD files,
,PDF document viewer,
,Security Alerts of known ,Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures, in different packages,
,GitHub's Terms of Service do not require public software projects hosted on GitHub to meet the ,Open Source Definition,. The ,terms of service, state, ""By setting your repositories to be viewed publicly, you agree to allow others to view and fork your repositories."",[84],
,
,GitHub Enterprise,[,edit,],
,GitHub Enterprise is a self-managed version of GitHub with similar functionality. It can be run on an organization's hardware or a cloud provider and has been available as of November 2011,[update],.,[85], In November 2020, source code for GitHub Enterprise Server was leaked online in an apparent protest against DMCA takedown of ,youtube-dl,. According to GitHub, the source code came from GitHub accidentally sharing the code with Enterprise customers themselves, not from an attack on GitHub servers.,[86],[87],
,
,GitHub Pages,[,edit,],
,As of 2008,[update],, GitHub has offered ,GitHub Pages,, a ,static, ,web hosting service, for ,blogs,, project documentation,,[88],[89], and books.,[90],
,All GitHub Pages content is stored in a Git repository as files served to visitors verbatim or in ,Markdown, format. GitHub is integrated with ,Jekyll, static website and blog generator and GitHub continuous integration pipelines. Each time the content source is updated, Jekyll regenerates the website and automatically serves it via GitHub Pages infrastructure.,[91],
,Like the rest of GitHub, it includes free and paid service tiers. Websites generated through this service are hosted either as ,subdomains, of the github.io domain or can be connected to custom ,domains, bought through a third-party ,domain name registrar,.,[92], GitHub Pages supports HTTPS encryption.,[93],[94],
,
,Gist,[,edit,],
,GitHub also operates a ,pastebin,-style site called ,Gist,, which is for ,code snippets,, as opposed to GitHub proper, which is usually used for larger projects.,[16], Tom Preston-Werner débuted the feature at a Ruby conference in 2008.,[95],
,Gist builds on the traditional simple concept of a ,pastebin, by adding version control for code snippets, easy forking, and ,TLS encryption, for private pastes. Because each ""gist"" is its own Git repository, multiple code snippets can be contained in a single page, and they can be pushed and pulled using Git.,[96],
,Unregistered users could upload Gists until March 19, 2018, when uploading Gists was restricted to logged-in users, reportedly to mitigate ,spamming, on the page of recent Gists.,[97],
,Gists' ,URLs, use hexadecimal IDs, and edits to Gists are recorded in a ,revision history,, which can show the text difference of thirty revisions per page with an option between a ""split"" and ""unified"" view. Like repositories, Gists can be forked, ""starred"", i.e., publicly bookmarked, and commented on. The count of revisions, stars, and forks is indicated on the gist page.,[98],
,
,Education program,[,edit,],
,GitHub launched a new program called the GitHub Student Developer Pack to give students free access to more than a dozen popular development tools and services. GitHub partnered with ,Bitnami,, ,Crowdflower,, ,DigitalOcean,, DNSimple, ,HackHands,, ,Namecheap,, Orchestrate, Screenhero, ,SendGrid,, ,Stripe,, ,Travis CI,, and ,Unreal Engine, to launch the program.,[99],
,In 2016, GitHub announced the launch of the GitHub Campus Experts program,[100], to train and encourage students to grow technology communities at their universities. The Campus Experts program is open to university students 18 years and older worldwide.,[101], GitHub Campus Experts are one of the primary ways that GitHub funds student-oriented events and communities, Campus Experts are given access to training, funding, and additional resources to run events and grow their communities. To become a Campus Expert, applicants must complete an online training course with multiple modules to develop community leadership skills.
,
,GitHub Marketplace service,[,edit,],
,GitHub also provides some ,software as a service, (SaaS) integrations for adding extra features to projects. Those services include:
,
,Waffle.io: Project management for software teams. Automatically see pull requests, automated builds, reviews, and deployments across all of your repositories in GitHub.,[102],
,Rollbar: Integrate with GitHub to provide real-time debugging tools and full-stack exception reporting. It is compatible with all popular code languages, such as ,JavaScript,, ,Python,, ,.NET,, ,Ruby,, ,PHP,, ,Node.js,, ,Android,, ,iOS,, ,Go,, ,Java,, and ,C#,.,[103],[104],
,Codebeat: For automated code analysis specialized in web and mobile developers. The supported languages for this software are ,Elixir,, ,Go,, ,Java,, ,Swift,, ,JavaScript,, ,Python,, ,Ruby,, ,Kotlin,, ,Objective-C,, and ,TypeScript,.,
,Travis CI,: To provide confidence for your apps while doing test and ship. It also gives full control over the build environment to adapt to the code. Supported languages: ,Go,, ,Java,, ,JavaScript,, ,Objective-C,, ,Python,, ,PHP,, ,Ruby,, and ,Swift,.,
,GitLocalize: Developed for teams that are translating their content from one point to another. GitLocalize automatically syncs with your repository so you can keep your workflow on GitHub. It also keeps you updated on what needs to be translated.,
,GitHub Sponsors,[,edit,],
,GitHub Sponsors allows users to make monthly money donations to projects hosted on GitHub.,[105], The public beta was announced on May 23, 2019, and the project accepts waitlist registrations. ,The Verge, said that GitHub Sponsors ""works exactly like ,Patreon,"" because ""developers can offer various funding tiers that come with different perks, and they'll receive recurring payments from supporters who want to access them and encourage their work"" except with ""zero fees to use the program."" Furthermore, GitHub offers incentives for early adopters during the first year: it pledges to cover payment processing costs and match sponsorship payments up to $5,000 per developer. Furthermore, users can still use similar services like Patreon and Open Collective and link to their websites.,[106],[107],
,
,GitHub Archive Program,[,edit,],
,In July 2020, GitHub stored a February archive of the site,[59], in an abandoned mountain mine in ,Svalbard,, Norway, part of the ,Arctic World Archive, and not far from the ,Svalbard Global Seed Vault,. The archive contained the code of all active public repositories, as well as that of dormant but significant public repositories. The 21,TB, of data was stored on ,piqlFilm, archival film reels as ,matrix (2D) barcode, (,Boxing barcode,), and is expected to last 500–1,000 years.,[108],[109],[110],[111],
,The GitHub Archive Program is also working with partners on Project Silica, in an attempt to store all public repositories for 10,000 years. It aims to write archives into the molecular structure of ,quartz glass, platters, using a high-precision ,petahertz, pulse laser, i.e. one that pulses a ,quadrillion, (1,000,000,000,000,000) times per second.,[111],

,Harassment allegations,[,edit,],
,In March 2014, GitHub programmer Julie Ann Horvath alleged that founder and CEO Tom Preston-Werner and his wife, Theresa, engaged in a pattern of ,harassment, against her that led to her leaving the company.,[112], In April 2014, GitHub released a statement denying Horvath's allegations.,[113],[114],[115], However, following an internal investigation, GitHub confirmed the claims. GitHub's CEO Chris Wanstrath wrote on the company blog, ""The investigation found Tom Preston-Werner in his capacity as GitHub's CEO acted inappropriately, including confrontational conduct, disregard of workplace complaints, insensitivity to the impact of his spouse's presence in the workplace, and failure to enforce an agreement that his spouse should not work in the office."",[116], Preston-Werner subsequently resigned from the company.,[117], The firm then announced it would implement new initiatives and trainings ""to make sure employee concerns and conflicts are taken seriously and dealt with appropriately."",[117],
,
,Sanctions,[,edit,],
,On July 25, 2019, a developer based in Iran wrote on ,Medium, that GitHub had blocked his private repositories and prohibited access to GitHub pages.,[118], Soon after, GitHub confirmed that it was now blocking developers in ,Iran,, ,Crimea,, ,Cuba,, ,North Korea,, and ,Syria, from accessing private repositories.,[119], However, GitHub reopened access to GitHub Pages days later, for public repositories regardless of location. It was also revealed that using GitHub while visiting sanctioned countries could result in similar actions occurring on a user's account. GitHub responded to complaints and the media through a spokesperson, saying:
,
,GitHub is subject to US trade control laws, and is committed to full compliance with applicable law. At the same time, GitHub's vision is to be the global platform for ,developer, collaboration, no matter where developers reside. As a result, we take seriously our responsibility to examine government mandates thoroughly to be certain that users and customers are not impacted beyond what is required by law. This includes keeping public repositories services, including those for open source projects, available and accessible to support personal communications involving developers in sanctioned regions.,[120],[121],
,Developers who feel that they should not have restrictions can appeal for the removal of said restrictions, including those who only travel to, and do not reside in, those countries. GitHub has forbidden the use of ,VPNs, and ,IP proxies, to access the site from sanctioned countries, as purchase history and IP addresses are how they flag users, among other sources.,[122],
,
,Censorship,[,edit,],
,Main article: ,Censorship of GitHub,On December 4, 2014, Russia blacklisted GitHub.com because GitHub initially refused to take down user-posted suicide manuals.,[123], After a day, Russia withdrew its block,,[124], and GitHub began blocking specific content and pages in Russia.,[125], On December 31, 2014, India blocked GitHub.com along with 31 other websites over pro-,ISIS, content posted by users;,[126], the block was lifted three days later.,[127], On October 8, 2016, Turkey blocked GitHub to prevent email leakage of a hacked account belonging to the country's energy minister.,[128],
,On March 26, 2015, a large-scale ,DDoS, attack was launched against GitHub.com that lasted for just under five days.,[129], The attack, which appeared to originate from China, primarily targeted GitHub-hosted user content describing methods of ,circumventing Internet censorship,.,[130],[131],[132],
,On April 19, 2020, Chinese police detained Chen Mei and Cai Wei (volunteers for Terminus 2049, a project hosted on GitHub), and accused them of ""picking quarrels and provoking trouble."" Cai and Chen archived news articles, interviews, and other materials published on Chinese media outlets and social media platforms that have been removed by censors in China.,[133],
,
,ICE contract,[,edit,],
,GitHub has a $200,000 contract with ,U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, (ICE) for the use of their on-site product GitHub Enterprise Server. This contract was renewed in 2019, despite internal opposition from many GitHub employees. In an email sent to employees, later posted to the GitHub blog on October 9, 2019, CEO ,Nat Friedman, stated, ""The revenue from the purchase is less than $200,000 and not financially material for our company."" He announced that GitHub had pledged to donate $500,000 to ""nonprofit groups supporting immigrant communities targeted by ,the current administration,."",[134], In response, at least 150 GitHub employees signed an open letter re-stating their opposition to the contract, and denouncing alleged human rights abuses by ICE. As of November 13, 2019, five workers had resigned over the contract.,[135],[136],[137],
,The ICE contract dispute came into focus again in June 2020 due to the company's decision ,to abandon ""master/slave"" branch terminology,, spurred by the George Floyd protests and ,Black Lives Matter, movement.,[138], Detractors of GitHub describe the branch renaming to be a form of ,performative activism, and have urged GitHub to cancel their ICE contract instead.,[139], An open letter from members of the open source community was shared on GitHub in December 2019, demanding that the company drop its contract with ICE and provide more transparency into how they conduct business and partnerships. The letter has been signed by more than 700 people.,[140],
,
,Capitol riot comments and employee firing,[,edit,],
,In January 2021, GitHub fired one of its employees after he expressed concern for colleagues following the ,January 6 United States Capitol attack,, calling some of the rioters ""Nazis"".,[141], After an investigation, GitHub's COO said there were ""significant errors of judgment and procedure"" with the company's decision to fire the employee. As a result of the investigation, GitHub reached out to the employee, and the company's head of human resources resigned.,[142],[143],
,
,Twitter source code leak,[,edit,],
,In 2023, parts of the social media platform ,Twitter, were uploaded onto GitHub. The leak was first reported by the ,New York Times, and was part of a legal filing Twitter submitted to the ,United States District Court for the Northern District of California,. Twitter claimed that the postings infringed on copyright property owned by them, and asked the court for information to identify the user who posted the source code to GitHub, under the username ""FreeSpeechEnthusiast"".,[144],
,
,Reception,[,edit,],
,Linus Torvalds,, the original developer of the Git software, has highly praised GitHub by stating ""The hosting of github [,sic,] is excellent. They've done a good job on that. I think GitHub should be commended enormously for making open source project hosting so easy."" However, he also sharply criticized the implementation of GitHub's merging interface, stating that ""Git comes with a nice pull-request generation module, but GitHub instead decided to replace it with their own totally inferior version. As a result, I consider GitHub useless for these kinds of things. It's fine for hosting, but the pull requests and the online commit editing, are just pure garbage."",[145],[146],
,
,Developed projects,[,edit,],
,Atom,, a free and open-source text and source code editor (discontinued in 2022),
,Electron,, an open-source framework to use JavaScript-based websites as desktop applications.,

,Current status,Online,
,CNET, (short for ""Computer Network""),[1], is an American media website that publishes reviews, news, articles, blogs, podcasts, and videos on technology and ,consumer electronics, globally. CNET originally produced content for radio and television in addition to its website before applying ,new media, distribution methods through its ,internet television, network, ,CNET Video,, and its podcast and blog networks.
,Founded in 1992 by ,Halsey Minor, and Shelby Bonnie, it was the flagship brand of CNET Networks and became a brand of ,CBS Interactive, through that unit's acquisition of CNET Networks in 2008.,[2],[3],[4],[5], It has been owned by ,Red Ventures, since October 30, 2020.,[6], 
,In recent years, the website has faced criticism for the decline in quality of its editorial content and its factual unreliability due to the use of ,generative AI, in the creation of its articles,,[7],[8], as well as concerns over its journalistic integrity after it began increased publication of biased reviews and ,sponsored content, to benefit its ,advertising, partners.,[9],
,
,
,History,[,edit,],
,Origins,[,edit,],
,Logo of CNET Networks prior to acquisition by CBS Interactive,
,Former CNET logo from 1994 to 2008 and 2011 to 2022,
,After leaving ,PepsiCo,, Halsey Minor and Shelby Bonnie launched c/net, a 24-hour cable network about computers and technology in 1992.,[1], With help from ,Fox Network, co-founder Kevin Wendle,[10], and former Disney creative associate Dan Baker,,[11], CNET produced four pilot television programs about computers, technology, and the Internet. ,CNET TV, was composed of ,CNET Central,, ,The Web,, and ,The New Edge,.,[12],[13], ,CNET Central, was created first and aired in ,syndication, in the ,United States, on the ,USA Network,. Later, it began airing on USA's sister network ,Sci-Fi Channel, along with ,The Web, and ,The New Edge,.,[12], These were later followed by ,TV.com, in 1996. Media personality ,Ryan Seacrest, first came to national prominence at CNET, as the host of ,The New Edge,[14], and doing various voice-over work for CNET.
,CNET online launched in June 1995.,[1], CNET, Inc., the site's owner, had its ,initial public offering, (IPO) in July 1996.,[15], In 1998, CNET, Inc. was sued by Snap Technologies, operators of the education service CollegeEdge, for ,trademark infringement, relating to CNET, Inc.'s ownership of the domain name Snap.com, due to Snap Technologies ,already owning a trademark on its name,.,[16],
,CNET produced another television technology news program called ,News.com, that aired on ,CNBC, beginning in 1999.,[11], From 2001 to 2003, it operated CNET Radio on the ,Clear Channel,-owned ,KNEW, (910) in the ,San Francisco Bay Area,, ,WBPS, (890) in ,Boston,, and ,XM Satellite Radio,. CNET Radio offered technology-themed programming. After failing to attract a sufficient audience, CNET Radio ceased operating in January 2003 due to financial losses.,[17],
,
,Acquisitions and expansions,[,edit,],
,In July 1999, CNET, Inc. acquired the ,Swiss,-based company GDT, later renamed to CNET Channel.,[18],[19], In 1998, CNET, Inc. granted the right to Asiacontent.com to set up CNET Asia and the operation was brought back in December 2000.,[20], In January 2000, the same time CNET, Inc. became CNET Networks,,[21], it acquired comparison shopping site mySimon for $736 million.,[22],[23], In October 2000, CNET Networks acquired ,ZDNET, for approximately $1.6 billion.,[24],[25],[26], In January 2001, ,Ziff Davis, reached an agreement with CNET Networks to regain the URLs lost in the 2000 sale of Ziff Davis to ,SoftBank,, a publicly traded Japanese media and technology company. In April 2001, CNET acquired ,TechRepublic,, which provides content for IT professionals from ,Gartner,, for $23 million in cash and stock.,[27],[28], In May 2002, CNET Networks acquired Smartshop, an automated product catalog and feature comparison technology company, for an undisclosed amount.,[29],
,On July 14, 2004, CNET Networks announced that it would acquire photography website ,Webshots, for $70 million ($60 million in cash, $10 million in deferred consideration),,[30], completing the acquisition that same month.,[31],[32], In October 2007, it sold Webshots to ,American Greetings, for $45 million.,[33],[34], In August 2005, CNET Networks acquired ,Metacritic,, a ,review aggregation website,, for an undisclosed amount.,[35],
,In 2005, Google representatives refused to be interviewed by all CNET reporters for a year after CNET published Google's CEO ,Eric Schmidt,'s salary and named the neighborhood where he lives, as well as some of his hobbies and political donations.,[36], All the information had been gleaned from Google searches.,[37],[38],
,In September 2006, CNET acquired ,Chowhound,, an online food community.,[39],
,On October 10, 2006, Shelby Bonnie resigned as chairman and ,CEO,, in addition to two other executives, as a result of a ,stock options backdating, scandal that occurred between 1996 and 2003.,[40], This would also cause the firm to restate its financial earnings over 1996 to 2003 for over $105 million in resulting expenses.,[41], The ,Securities and Exchange Commission, later dropped an investigation into the practice. Neil Ashe was named as the new CEO.,[42],[43],[44],
,In December 2006, ,James Kim,, an editor at CNET, died in the Oregon wilderness. CNET hosted a memorial show and podcasts dedicated to him.,[45],
,On March 1, 2007, CNET announced the public launch of BNET, a website targeted towards business managers. BNET had been running under beta status since 2005.,[46], In 2008 programmer ,Chris Wanstrath,, who worked on GameSpot and Chowhound, left CNET to start ,GitHub,.,[47],
,
,CBS Corporation ownership,[,edit,],
,On May 15, 2008, it was announced that ,CBS Corporation, would buy CNET Networks for ,US$ ,1.8 billion.,[3],[4],[48],[49], On June 30, 2008, the acquisition was completed.,[50], Former CNET Networks properties were managed under ,CBS Interactive, at the time. CBS Interactive acquired many ,domain, names originally created by CNET Networks, including ,download.com,, downloads.com, upload.com, news.com, search.com, ,TV.com,, ,mp3.com,, chat.com, computers.com, shopper.com, com.com, and cnet.com. It also held ,radio.com, until ,CBS Radio, was sold to ,Entercom, in 2017.,[51],
,In 2011, CNET and CBS Interactive were sued by a coalition of artists (led by FilmOn founder Alki David) for ,copyright infringement, by promoting the download of ,LimeWire,, a popular ,peer to peer, downloading software.,[52],[53], Although the original suit was voluntarily dropped by Alki David, he vowed to sue at a later date to bring ""expanded"",[54], action against CBS Interactive. In November 2011, another lawsuit against CBS Interactive was introduced, claiming that CNET and CBS Interactive knowingly distributed LimeWire, the file sharing software.,[55],
,On September 19, 2013, CBS Interactive launched a ,Spanish language, sister site under the name CNET en Español.,[56], It focuses on topics of relevance primarily to Spanish-speaking technology enthusiasts. The site offered a ""new perspective"" on technology and is under the leadership of managing editor Gabriel Sama.,[57], The site not only offered news and tutorials, but also had a robust reviews section that it was led by Juan Garzon. After Red Ventures' acquisition, the company announced the closing of CNET en Español on November 11, 2020, leaving the largest tech site in Spanish in the US out of the market.
,In March 2014, CNET refreshed its site by merging with CNET UK and vowing to merge all editions of the agency into a unified agency. This merge brought many changes, foremost of which would be a new user interface and the renaming of CNET TV as CNET Video.
,
,Red Ventures ownership,[,edit,],
,Red Ventures, announced in September 2020 that it would acquire CNET from ,ViacomCBS, for $500 million.,[58],[59], The transaction was completed on October 30, 2020.,[6],
,In November 2022, CNET began publishing articles written with ,artificial intelligence, and edited by humans.,[60], CNET was criticized for failing to disclose that it was using a machine to write articles,,[61], and for using human bylines on some AI-generated content until caught by independent investigators.,[62], CNET reviewed those articles in January 2023 after many were found to contain serious errors and plagiarized material.,[63],[8], CNET reporters said Red Ventures pushed them to give more favourable coverage to advertisers and work on sponsored content.,[9], Subsequently, 10% of CNET staff were laid off.,[64], Employees unionized in response to the scandal and layoffs, saying AI-generated content posed a danger to their professional reputations.,[64],[65],[66], A former staffer demanded that her byline be removed from the site, in order to protect her reputation if her articles were revised by AI.,[67],
,In August 2023, CNET had deleted thousands of old articles from their website in an effort to raise the ,search engine optimization, rankings on ,Google Search,.,[68],[69], Before an article is deleted on its website, CNET creates an internal copy and another to ,Wayback Machine,. The writer, if still employed by CNET, is also alerted 10 days in advance.,[68],[70], ,Google, said deleting articles to optimize for search engine rankings is not a good practice.,[70],
,In January 2024, ,Axios, reported that Red Ventures was exploring a sale of the website, with a goal of attaining at least $250 million for it. The site was profitable at the time.,[64], The approximate halving of CNET's value under Red Ventures' ownership is attributed to interest rates, a slower ad market, and the reputational damage to CNET caused by the AI scandals.,[71],

,Gamecenter,[,edit,],
,CNET launched a website to cover ,video games,, ,CNET Gamecenter,, in the middle of 1996.,[77], According to the ,San Francisco Chronicle,, it was ""one of the first Web sites devoted to computer gaming news"".,[78], It became a leading game-focused website;,[79],[80], in 1999, ,PC Magazine, named it one of the hundred-best websites in any field, alongside competitors ,IGN, and ,GameSpot,.,[81], According to ,Gamecenter, head Michael Brown, the site received between 50,000 and 75,000 daily visitors by late 2000.,[77], In May 2000, CNET founded the Gamecenter Alliance network to bring ,Gamecenter, and four partner websites, including ,Inside Mac Games,, under one banner.,[82], Nielsen//NetRatings ranked Gamecenter the sixth-most-popular gaming website in the United States by mid-2000.,[83],
,On July 19, 2000, CNET, Inc. made public its plan to buy ,Ziff-Davis, and its ,ZDNet, Internet business for $1.6 billion.,[84], Because ZDNet had partnered with SpotMedia—parent company of ,GameSpot,—in late 1996,,[85], the acquisition brought both ,GameSpot, and ,Gamecenter, under CNET, Inc.'s ownership.,[79],[86], Later that year, ,The New York Times, described the two publications as the "",Time, and ,Newsweek, of gaming sites"". The paper reported that ,Gamecenter, ""seem[ed] to be thriving"" amid the ,dot-com crash,, with its revenue distributed across ,online advertising, and an ,affiliate sales program, with CNET's ,Game Shopper, website,,[77], launched in late 1999.,[87],
,Following an almost $400 million loss at CNET as a result of the dot-com crash, the company ended the Gamecenter Alliance network in January 2001.,[86],[88], On February 7, ,Gamecenter, itself was closed in a redundancy reduction effort, as ,GameSpot, was the more successful of the two sites.,[78],[86], Around 190 jobs were cut from CNET during this period,,[88], including ""at least 20"" at ,Gamecenter,, according to the ,San Francisco Chronicle,.,[78], Discussing the situation, Tom Bramwell of ,Eurogamer, reported, ""It is thought [...] that very few if any of the website's staff will move sideways into jobs at ,GameSpot,, now the company's other gaming asset."",[88], ,The Washington Post, later noted that ,Gamecenter, was among the ""popular video-game news sites"" to close in 2001, alongside ,Daily Radar,.,[89],
,
,Criticism,[,edit,],
,Hopper controversy,[,edit,],
,In January 2013, CNET named ,Dish Network,'s ""Hopper with ,Sling,"" ,digital video recorder, as a nominee for the ,CES, ""Best in Show"" award (which is decided by CNET on behalf of its organizers), and named it the winner in a vote by the site's staff. However, CBS abruptly disqualified the Hopper, and vetoed the results because the company was in ,active litigation, with Dish Network. CNET also announced that it could no longer review any product or service provided by companies that CBS are in litigation with (which also includes ,Aereo,). The new vote subsequently gave the Best in Show award to the ,Razer Edge, tablet instead.,[90],[91],[92],
,Dish Network's CEO Joe Clayton said that the company was ""saddened that CNET's staff is being denied its editorial independence because of CBS' heavy-handed tactics."",[90], On January 14, 2013, editor-in-chief Lindsey Turrentine addressed the situation, stating that CNET's staff were in an ""impossible"" situation due to the ,conflict of interest, posed by the situation, and promised that she would do everything within her power to prevent a similar incident from occurring again. The conflict also prompted one CNET senior writer, Greg Sandoval, to resign.,[91],
,The decision also drew the ire of staff from the ,Consumer Electronics Association,, the organizers of CES; CEO ,Gary J. Shapiro, criticized the decision in a ,USA Today, ,op-ed, column and a statement by the CEA, stating that ""making television easier to watch is not against the law. It is simply pro-innovation and pro-consumer."" Shapiro felt that the decision also hurt the confidence of CNET's readers and staff, ""destroying its reputation for editorial integrity in an attempt to eliminate a new market competitor."" As a result of the controversy and fearing damage to the show's brand, the CEA announced on January 31, 2013, that CNET will no longer decide the CES Best in Show award winner due to the interference of CBS (the position has been offered to other technology publications), and the ""Best in Show"" award was jointly awarded to both the Hopper with Sling and Razer Edge.,[92],
,
,Malware in downloads,[,edit,],
,With a catalog of more than 400,000 titles, the Downloads section of the website allows users to download popular software. CNET's download.com provides ,Windows,, ,Macintosh,, and mobile software for download. CNET claims that this software is free of ,spyware,, but independent sources have confirmed that this is not the case. While ,Download.com, is overall a safe place to download programs, precautions should be taken before downloading from the site, as some downloads do contain malware.,[93],[94],[95],[96],
,
,Artificial intelligence content (2023),[,edit,],
,In January 2023, ,Wikipedia editors, began the process of downgrading CNET's reliability rating as a source following the revelation that CNET was publishing content generated by ,artificial intelligence,. In response to the decision, CNET claimed it maintained high editorial standards, stating, ""It is important to clarify that CNET is not actively using AI to create new content. While we have no specific plans to restart, any future initiatives would follow our public AI policy."",[65],[7],

,Type of site,News,Available in,English,Created by,Nicholas White,Editor,Whitney Jefferson,[1],URL,dailydot,.com,Commercial,Yes,Launched,August 23, 2011,; 12 years ago, (,2011-08-23,),
,The Daily Dot, is a ,digital media, company covering ,the culture of the Internet, and the ,World Wide Web,. It was founded by Nicholas White in 2011, and is headquartered in ,Austin, Texas,.,[2],
,The site, conceived as the Internet's ""hometown newspaper"",,[3], focuses on topics such as streaming entertainment, geek culture, ,memes,, ,gadgets, and social issues, such as ,LGBT,, ,gender, and ,race,. In addition, an e-commerce arm produces branded video for advertisers and sells items from an online marketplace.,[3],[4],
,
,
,History,[,edit,],
,The Daily Dot, was established in 2011 by Nicholas White, whose goal was to cover Internet communities such as ,Reddit, and ,Tumblr, in the same manner as hometown newspapers cover their own communities. White's family has been in the newspaper business since buying the ,Sandusky Register, in Ohio in 1869, and White was a reporter and executive with the family's media company before establishing the site.,[5],
,White launched ,The Daily Dot, with $600,000 and a handful of full-time reporters. Many of the site's early stories were filed to a ,Google Doc, and reported on ,Facebook, and ,Twitter,. After establishing a headquarters in ,Austin, Texas,, the company added other offices but many staff worked remotely from other locations.,[5],  It raised a $10 million private investment to add staff, produce digital content and develop its internal creative agency in 2015, ramping up its output to 50–70 stories a day.,[2],[6], Its coverage has focused on ""under-reported"",[5], areas while emphasizing progressive issues such as ,body positivity, and feminism. White has also highlighted the need to diversify his staff. ""Journalism has been dominated by a few select types of voices. We have an opportunity to break from that cycle"" he has said.,[2],
,The Daily Dot, has pursued several content strategies while building its online presence. In 2012, it was one of the first major sites to launch dedicated ,esports, coverage. In 2016, the company sold that section, Dot Esports, to ,Gamurs,, an Australian esports multimedia operation.,[7],
,In 2014, it purchased ,The Kernel,, a competing website, and turned it into a weekly Sunday edition featuring long-form editorial built around a single theme. ,The Kernel, founder and editor-in-chief ,Milo Yiannopoulos, stepped down following the acquisition.,[8], The Kernel ceased regular publication in 2016.,[9],
,It also has collaborated on video projects with partners including ,HLN,, on a co-branded series called Next Sex;,[10], the ,U.S. Department of Health and Human Services,, for which it produced a public service announcement encouraging ,vaccination, featuring ,Sesame Street, character ,Elmo, and former Surgeon General ,Vivek Murthy,;,[11], and television cooking personality ,Alton Brown,, whose review of kitchen gadgets garnered many millions of views on ,YouTube,.,[12],[13],
,In January 2016, the site launched ,VIP Voices,, a collection of op-eds from high-profile contributors on Internet issues in public discourse. Contributors include Mayor ,Bill de Blasio,, Representative ,Ted Lieu,, and Senator ,Mike Lee,.,[14],[15],
,In 2018, ,The Daily Dot, sued the ,New York Police Department, to access handgun license applications filed by ,Donald Trump, and two of his sons, ,Donald Trump Jr., and ,Eric Trump,.,[16], The suit alleges that the NYPD declined a request made by ,The Daily Dot, under New York's Freedom of Information Law to release the information, citing privacy and safety concerns; the site argues the information should be public.,[17],
,The company had a full-time staff of 76, in addition to 222 freelance contributors, in early 2016,[2], before laying off 40% of its total staff in September 2016.,[18], White, who called the layoff a ""restructuring"", said the move was necessary to refocus resources on growing areas such as video, e-commerce and sales.,[19], The site's e-commerce videos, produced in conjunction with advertisers, are shared on Facebook and generate revenue by sharing a portion of sales. In addition, the site has built two online storefronts, the Bazaar and The Daily Dot Store, on which it sells items.,[4],
,
,Awards,[,edit,],
,The site's coverage has been recognized by the following outlets:
,

,2015 finalist, Digiday Publisher of the Year, for its investigation of a data breach at global intelligence firm ,Stratfor,.,[21],[22],

" 27 March 2024, at 19:00","Extent to which employers encourage employees to share in organizational decision-making,
,.mw-parser-output .hatnote{font-style:italic}.mw-parser-output div.hatnote{padding-left:1.6em;margin-bottom:0.5em}.mw-parser-output .hatnote i{font-style:normal}.mw-parser-output .hatnote+link+.hatnote{margin-top:-0.5em},For a discussion of public involvement in political, economic, or other social decisions, see ,Participation (decision making),.,
,
,Participative decision-making, (,PDM,) is the extent to which ,employers, allow or encourage employees to share or participate in organizational ,decision-making,.,[1], According to Cotton et al., the format of PDM could be formal or informal.,[2], In addition, the degree of participation could range from zero to 100% in different participative management (PM) stages.,[2],[3],
,PDM is one of many ways in which an organization can make decisions. The leader must think of the best possible way that will allow the organization to achieve the best results. According to ,Abraham Maslow,, workers need to feel a sense of belonging to an organization (see ,Maslow's hierarchy of needs,).,[,citation needed,],
,
,
,Introduction,[,edit,],
"",Participative management, (PM) is known by many names including ,shared leadership,, employee empowerment, employee involvement, participative decision-making, dispersed leadership, open-book management, or ,industrial democracy,"".,[4], ,""The basic concept involves any power-sharing arrangement in which workplace influence is shared among individuals who are otherwise ,hierarchical, unequals. Such power-sharing arrangements may entail various employee involvement schemes resulting in co-determination of working conditions, problem solving, and decision-making"".,[5],The primary aim of PDM is for the organization to benefit from the ""perceived motivational effects of increased employee involvement"",[6],
,Advantages,[,edit,],
,PM is important where a large number of ,stakeholders, are involved from different walks of life, coming together to make a decision which may benefit everyone. Some examples are decisions for the environment, ,health care,, anti-animal cruelty and other similar situations. In this case, everyone can be involved, from experts, ,NGOs,, government agencies, to volunteers and members of public.
,However, organizations may benefit from the perceived ,motivational, influences of employees. When employees participate in the ,decision-making, process, they may improve understanding and perceptions among colleagues and superiors, and enhance personnel value in the organization.
,Participatory decision-making by the top management team can ensure the completeness of decision-making and may increase team member commitment to final decisions. In a participative decision-making process each team member has an opportunity to share their perspectives, voice their ideas and tap their skills to improve team ,effectiveness, and ,efficiency,.
,Participatory decision-making can have a wide array of organizational benefits. Researchers have found that PDM may positively impact the following:
,
,Job satisfaction,
,Organizational commitment,
,Perceived organizational support,
,Organizational citizenship behavior,
,Labor-management relations,
,Job performance and organizational performance,
,Organizational profits,
,By sharing decision-making with other employees, participants may eventually achieve organization ,objectives, that influence them.,[7], In this process, PDM can be used as a tool that may enhance relationships in the organization, increase employee work ,incentives,, and increase the rate of information circulation across the organization,[8],
,
,Outcomes,[,edit,],
,The outcomes are various in PDM. In the aspect of employees, PDM refers to job satisfaction and ,performance,, which are usually recognized as commitment and ,productivity,[9], In the aspect of employers, PDM is evolved into ,decision quality, and efficiency that influenced by multiple and differential mixed layers in terms of ,information access,, level of participation, processes and dimensions in PDM.
,Research primarily focuses on the work satisfaction and performance of employees in PDM.,[2],[10],[11],[7], Different measurement systems were applied to identify the two items and the relevant properties. If they are measured with different processes in PDM, the relationship is as described below:,[10],
,
,Identifying problems: Do not have strong relationship with performance. Because even with full participation, participants may not explore their skills and knowledge in identifying problems, which is likely to weaken the desires and motivation then influence performance.,
,Providing solutions: Positive and ""potentially strong"" relations with performance.,[12], It is not only attributed to the skills and ,knowledge, could be explored but also the innovative ways employees can provide and generate.,
,Selecting solutions: Positive to performance but not likely to enhance satisfaction. If the solutions generated are not acknowledged by the employees who are absent at the previous stage, the satisfaction could lessen.,
,Planning implementation: Positive and strong relationship with both performance and satisfaction. Participants are given the possibility to affect the achievement of a designed plan. As the ""value attainment"" is attached, the extent of performance and work satisfaction increase.,[13],
,Evaluating results: Weaker relationship with performance, but positive relationship with satisfaction due to the future benefit.,
,Disadvantages,[,edit,],
One of the primary risks in any participative decision-making or ,power-sharing, process is that the desire on the part of the ,management, for more inclusive participation is not genuine. In the words of Arnstein,,""There is a critical difference between going through the empty ritual of participation and having the real power needed to affect the outcome of the process. This difference is brilliantly capsulized in a poster [available for viewing in her article]... [which] highlights the fundamental point that participation without redistribution of power is an empty and frustrating process for the powerless. It allows the powerholders to claim that all sides were considered, but makes it possible for only some of those sides to benefit."",[14],When PDM takes place in a team setting, it can lead to social situations which cause adverse outcomes. These situations include group domination, where one person takes control of the group and urges everyone to follow their standpoints, and ,peer pressure,, where a larger group pressures a smaller group into compromise that they would not otherwise agree to. ,Time constraints, can also be an issue, especially for larger groups; it takes time to come up with ideas, communicate them, and then to rework plans to incorporate the ideas, and when there are many people involved in each step the time can add up and slow down the overall flow of decision-making. Setting time limits and hard deadlines can mitigate this at the risk of missing needed input if time runs out before all parties are heard.
,Possible negative outcomes of PDM are high costs, inefficiency, indecisiveness, and incompetence.,[15],
,Van der Helm, an independent ,futurist, based in ,the Hague,, The Netherlands, outlines ten major disadvantages, or ,dilemmas,, of increased participation.,[16], According to him, there are ten  dilemmas and the only way to deal with them is to use foresight.
,Ten dilemmas:,
,
,Participation as the answer and as the problem,
,The involvement of the actors,
,The level of ambition of the initiators, the context and the participants.,
,Representation and ,legitimization, – participation works best in a situation where it is not needed, i.e. in an environment in which all interests are taken into consideration,
,Knowledge, power and strategic behavior,
,Formalism, or freedom,
,Entering the debate: between timing and perseverance,
,Going beyond information: ,communication, and ,mediation,
,Results and non-results,
,Appreciating and apprehending success and failure,

,Decisions are made differently within organizations having diverse environments. A PDM style includes any type of decision transfer from a superior to their subordinates.,[17], PDM may take many forms and can run the gamut from informal suggestion systems to direct high involvement at the policy and administrative level. Most researchers agree that PDM is not a unitary concept. Somech,[18], delineates five aspects of PDM: decision domain, degree of participation, structure, target of participation, and rationale for the process.
,Steinheider, Bayerl and Wuestewald cited Huang as separating PDM into informal and formal types.,[4], Ledford,[18], distinguishes between three types of PDM: Suggestion Involvement, Job Involvement, and High Involvement. High involvement PDM entails power and information sharing, as well as advanced ,human resource development, practices.
,
,Democratic,[,edit,],
,Democratic leadership, also known as participative leadership, is a type of ,leadership style, in which members of the group take a more participative role in the decision-making process. Researchers have found that this leadership style is usually one of the most effective and leads to higher productivity, better contributions from group members, and increased group morale.,[19],
,The democratic leadership style involves facilitating the ,conversation,, encouraging people to share their ideas, and then synthesizing all the available information into the best possible decision. The democratic leader must also be able to communicate that decision back to the group to bring unity to the plan is chosen.,[20],
,The democratic leader ,delegates authority,, encourages participation, and relies on ,personal power, (expert and referent power) to manage subordinates. 
The subordinates with democratic leadership:
,
,Will perform just as highly as ,autocratic, leaders when he/she is present.,
,Will have positive feeling with this style of leadership.,
,Will perform well even when the leader is absent.,[21],
,When the workplace is ready for democratic leaders, the style produces a work environment that employees can feel good about. Workers feel that their opinion counts, and because of that feeling they are more committed to achieving the goals and objectives of the organization.,[22],
,
,Autocratic,[,edit,],
,In an autocratic participative decision-making style, similar to the collective style, the leader takes control of and responsibility for the final decision. The difference is that in an autocratic style, members of the organizations are not included and the final outcome is the responsibility of the leader. This is the best style to use in an emergency when an immediate decision is needed.,[23],
,
,Consensus,[,edit,],
,In a ,consensus, participative decision-making style, the leader gives up complete control and responsibility of the decision and leaves it to the members of the organization. Everyone must agree and come to the same decision. This might take a while, but the decisions are among the best since it involves the ideas and skills of many other people. ,Teamwork, is important in this style and brings members closer together while trust and communication increase.,[,citation needed,],
,
,Delegated by expertise,[,edit,],
,Decision makers cannot be experts in all fields. In such situations, the decision maker delegates full or partial responsibility of decision-making for a particular area of concern, to the expert on the team for best management outcomes. The participative leader retains the responsibility of final compilation of the draft responses from all. Such delegation is work specific and singular. It depends on the decision maker to compile the expert reports for the final response. Advantages of this type of decision-making process makes the group members feel engaged in the process, more motivated and creative. Expertise brings focused and result oriented solutions for BATNA (,Best alternative to a negotiated agreement,) as and when necessary. Best management outcomes are obtained by utilizing this strategy. An ,authoritative, decision maker would have a higher rate of success than the Democratic decision maker. This strategy would be a disaster, when applied incorrectly or inappropriately is a major disadvantage.,[,citation needed,],
,
,Concepts and methods,[,edit,],
,Dimensions,[,edit,],
,After Lewin's early research on PDM in 1947, scholars started to explore different dimensions of PDM.,[11], In 1988, it was indicated that six dimensions of PDM had been recognized and analyzed.,[2], Those six dimensions are as follows:
,
,Participation in work decisions: Characterized as formal, long-term and direct participation. The content in this dimension focuses on work, e.g. task distribution, organizational methods of the task.,
,Consultative, participation: Same to the previous one except it has lower level of influence in decision-making.,
,Short-term participation: Employees’ participation is temporary, ranges from sessions of several hours to campaigns of several days. It is recognized as formal and direct.,
,Informal participation: Could happen in ,interpersonal relationships, between employers and employees. Usually no fixed rules and specific contents are decided in advance.,
,Employee ownership: Formal and indirect participation. Although subordinates have the chance to participate in decision-making, usually the typical employees cannot.,
,Representative participation: Measured as formal and indirect. In organizations, the degree of the influence is medium as representatives playing a role that mediate between typical employees and superior.,
,Based on previous literature, Black and Gregersen also defined six different dimensions of PDM—rationale, structure, form, decision issues, degree of involvement and decision process—which can be seen in the table below:.,[10],
,
,

,
,Rationale,
,Democratic: employees have rights to participate in DM. Pragmatic: high work efficiency, productivity, profits, etc.
,
,
,Structure,
,Formal: the format has been decided previously. Informal: no fixed format, content, few rules.
,
,
,Form,
,Direct: immediately evolve in DM, present personal opinions. Indirect: representatives are assigned to participate in DM.
,
,
,Decision Issues,
,Includes 4 aspects: work and task design, work conditions, strategies and capital distribution.,[2],
,
,
,Degree of Involvement,
,Different level of involvement generates differential outcomes.
,
,
,Decision Process,
,Contains five processes: identify problems, solution-generating, select specific solution, planning and implementation the solution and evaluate the result.
,
,Additionally, employee outcomes can also be evaluated according to six criteria:,[7],
,
,Rationale: No distinct relationship with performance. However, high level of ,self-efficacy, contributes to higher performance.,[24],
,Structure: Informal PDM encourage job satisfaction, likewise higher level of commitment and motivation.,[2],
,Form: Direct PDM is more effective than indirect PDM. The greater influence enhances work satisfaction. Whereas the power range of indirect PDM could vary from partial to decisive.,
,Decision issues: The major issue relevant to decision contents is the skills and knowledge owning by employees.,[25], Relevant knowledge brings higher decision quality and efficiency; participants achieve ""value attainment"",.,[13], thereby raising performance and satisfaction.,
,Degree of involvement: Higher degree of involvement leads to greater control and then encourages employees’ performance and satisfaction.,
,Decision process: Planning task implementation is key to improving performance.,[25],
,Foresight,[,edit,],
,Some important constraints,:,[16],
,
,Foresight is a personal skill and so repetition should involve the same individuals (not institutions), which is not compatible with the people (rapidly) moving within and between organizations.,
,Foresight is often still a voluntary or peripheral job (i.e. few people make foresight their ,core business,), which demands great efforts of organizations and individuals. This may be done once, but not at a regular basis.,
,Foresight is often made at particular moments in time, which may help to converge the general attitude of the network. According to Ziegler,,[26], long-term vision is developed at critical historical moments (,the year 2000,, ,the ecological crisis,, the re-organization of a business, etc.). Obviously, these are not very likely to be formalized.,
,The results of a foresight are very often only indirectly visible in the follow-up in policy and management.,[27], Especially in a large exercise, it is very unlikely that individuals will find justice done to their ideas unless a serious consensus is reached.,
,Furthermore, because of the representation dilemma, it is unlikely that binding conclusions will be drawn from any similar activity. Hence, participants will not find any direct feedback and may lack the motivation to invest a second time.,
,Diamond model,[,edit,],
,According to Oostvogels' review,[28], of the book "",Facilitator's Guide to Participatory Decision-making"", by Sam Kaner et al.,,[29], the book is based on a concept called ""The Diamond of Participatory Decision-making"" which ""... is a schematic representation of the different stages in time through which a team has to move in order to develop a solution that is satisfactory to all.""
,
,Vigilant interaction theory,[,edit,],
,According to Papa et al., the vigilant interaction theory states that the quality of the group as a decision-making team is dependent upon the group's attentiveness during interaction.,[30], ,Critical thinking is, important for all group members in order to come up with the best possible solution to the decision.
,Four questions that should be asked:
,
,Analyze the problem – What needs to be fixed?,
,Think of objectives – What are we trying to accomplish with this decision?,
,Discuss choices – What possible choices can be used?,
,Evaluate – After coming up with choices, what are all of the positive and negative aspects of each?,
,Role of information,[,edit,],
,To make a good decision, there needs to be a good amount of information to base the outcome on. Information can include anything from charts and ,surveys, to past sales reports and prior research. When making a decision primarily based on the information you are given from your organization, one can come to a conclusion in four different ways.
,
,Decisive, – Little amount of information and one course of action. Decisions are made fast, direct, and firmly.,
,Flexible, – Little information available, but time is not an issue and they come up with many different courses of action.,
,Hierarchic, – Much information available, but one course of action is made.,
,Integrative, – Much information is available, and many decisions are made out of it.,[,citation needed,],
,Role of technology,[,edit,],
,A new kind of participative decision-making is communication through the computer, sometimes referred to as ""Decision-making through Computer-Mediated Technology"". Although a relatively new approach, this way can involve endless possibilities in order to reach a major organizational decision. There is a significant increase in more active and equal member participation. Individuals can talk to many other individuals at any time, regardless of geographic location and time zone. An organization can come together on a virtual site developed to make it easier to share ideas, share presentations and even have a chat room where anyone can add their input. Through a ,chat room,, members of the organizations are able to see what everyone says and no one is blocked from offering their ideas. This method also allows for a convenient ,archival, of past decision-making activities.,[31],
,Some disadvantages of computer-mediated meetings are that sometimes feedback can be slow or there can be many conversations under way at the same time, causing confusion. ,Flaming (Internet), is another computer-mediated problem which occurs when a person uses inappropriate behavior or language while interacting with another person online. Additionally, members also feel less personal and related to their team members.,[31],
,
,Applications,[,edit,],
,While PDM could conceivably be used in nearly any arena requiring decision-making, the specific examples below help to demonstrate that PDM is being used, where it is being used, and how that is occurring.
,
,Environment,[,edit,],
,Although participation in environmental decision-making processes can be granted or attained in many ways, and at many levels, one pivotal international instance establishing the rights of individuals to participate came via the ,Rio Declaration, in 1992. In Principle 10, that declaration sets out that ""[e]nvironmental decisions are best handled with the participation of all concerned citizens …"" who have ""... appropriate access to information concerning the environment held by public authorities …"" who are then rightly afforded ""… opportunity to participate in decision-making processes"".,[32],
,In ,Northern Germany,, while regulations have been changed to favor more participative forms of decision-making, planning approval decisions for wind farms are still mostly centralized. However, in the implementation of the Water Framework Directive for River Basin Management, stakeholder advisory groups were formed, which provide input to ,working groups,, to whom authority to decide issues by consensus has been delegated by the Federal Ministry of Agriculture, Environment, and Rural Areas.,[33],
,China has long had a reputation for centralized control of most aspects of daily life. However, since the introduction and success of market reforms, other areas including those linked to the environment have experienced increased openness toward participatory decision-making. In the case of pricing, management, and provision of ,water services,, the Chinese authorities have experimented with ,public hearings, as a way of acclimatizing citizens to the changes in approach and opportunities for their participation, such that ""…hundreds of formal public hearings on ,water tariffs, have been organized within 30 provinces, excluding Tibet"".,[34],
,Holley (2010) discusses a review of the extent to which the aims of new environmental governance (NEG) in Australia, including provisions for increased public participation, are being realized. After examining programs at the national and state levels, it was concluded that ""…in all but the most rare cases, there were substantial difficulties in fully satisfying the participatory aspirations of the three NEG programs."",[35],
,While progress is being made in many areas to increase participation in environmental decision-making, as evidenced in Holley's example above, much work remains to be done.
,
,Finance,[,edit,],
,In our modern world, PDM in business field of finance are mostly base on the three categories: Autocratic, Collective-participative and consensus participative. Most of the financial organization practices the first category which is the Autocratic; this is because leaders have little or no trust for their employees.
The Autocratic category of Decision Making allow the leader to make decision entirely on his or her own without any impute from others and take full responsibility for that decision. This style of decision-making is usually the best choice in case of emergency according to leadershipmanagement.com the decision maker may lose credibility if the decisions lead to a negative result.
,Collective-Participative decision-making is mostly practice after the Autocratic produced a negative result in an organization, the leaders may use this style of participative decision-making to fix the problem. Though the Collective-Participative decision-making is one of the best styles in business decision-making, they seem to be less practiced in our modern organization. The modern organization leaders does not care much about their employees ideas but they do care much about the organization ,profitability,, they also believe that making decision in this manner consume much time and may delay the organization from generating profit. Consensus style of participative decision-making is the less practiced style of decision-making in our financial organization because it consumes much time and requires much forbearance according to leadershipmanagment.com.

,eWeek, (,Enterprise Newsweekly,, stylized as ,eWEEK,), formerly ,PCWeek,,,[1], is a technology and business ,magazine,. Previously owned by ,QuinStreet,; Nashville, Tennessee marketing company TechnologyAdvice acquired eWeek in 2020.,[2],
,The print edition ceased in 2012, ""and eWeek became an all-digital publication""),,[3], at which time Quinstreet acquired the magazine from Internet company ,Ziff Davis,, along with Baseline.com, ChannelInsider.com,  CIOInsight.com, and WebBuyersGuide.com.,[4],
,eWeek, was started under the name ,PCWeek, on Feb. 28, 1984.,[5],  The magazine was called ,PCWeek, until 2000,,[1], during which time it covered the rise of business computing in America; as ,eWeek,, it increased its online presence and covers more kinds of worldwide technologies.
,
,
,History,[,edit,],
,Vol. 1, issue 42 (October 23, 1984),
,The magazine was started by ,Ziff Davis,[1], to cover the use of computers as business tools. 
,Team members that started ,PCWeek, included John Dodge, the first news editor; Lois Paul, the first features editor; and Sam Whitmore, the first reporter, who later went on to become editor-in-chief.,[6],
,Chris Dobbrow, who ""joined Ziff Davis Media ... as the associate publisher of PC Week, ... worked his way up the ladder at Ziff Davis, ... eventually becoming executive vice president."" A short story in The New York Times about him said ""He left in 2000 to join ... Last week, ... landed .. At eWeek. As the publisher. One step above the job he had 15 years ago."",[1],
,At the time, many magazines at the time already covered business computing, such as ,Datamation, and ,Computerworld,.  There were also magazines dedicated to hobbyist machines, so it seemed there was no place for a weekly issue to fit in. The first few issues had only 22 pages of advertising, but then ,PCWeek, began establishing itself.  By the end of the first year, the average number of advertising pages for the last month was 74.875.,[,citation needed,],
,
,Buyers' guides,[,edit,],
,John Pallatto, a writer for ,PCWeek, in its first year, produced a full buyer's guide on all DOS-compatible PCs on the market.,[7], 
,Early promotional publications from ,PCWeek, show them describing their key audience as ""volume buyers"", that is, people and companies that would buy PCs in bulk for business purposes.,[,citation needed,],  With this the magazine was able to show big computer companies that advertising in an issue of ,PCWeek, was the best possible way to get their product seen by the biggest and most important buyers.
,
,Later success,[,edit,],
,PCWeek, grew.  Scot Peterson became eWeek's main editor in 2005, having been, a Ziff-Davis employee 
since 1995, and previously held the title news editor.,[8],
,People involved in between ,PCWeek's, initial success and change to ,eWeek, were David Strom, Sam Whitmore, Mike Edelhart, ,Gina Smith,, Peter Coffee, Paul Bonner, current editor Chris Preimesberger and many others.,[9], 
,Jim Louderback, a lab director at ,PCWeek, as of 1991, describes how they were able to ""get a product in on Wednesday, review it, and have it on the front page on Monday"" and that ""that was something we were the first to do"".,[5], 
,In 2012, ,eWeek, and other Ziff Davis assets were acquired by the company ,QuinStreet,, which also runs other tech-oriented publications.,[4],
,
,Evolution,[,edit,],
,As the whole PC Industry evolved, ,PCWeek, grew, and also developed a very active audience that spoke of their experiences, good and bad. 
Successor ,eWeek, is even more oriented towards ""Lab-based product evaluation,"",[5], and covers a wide range tech topics.,[10],
,
,Writers,[,edit,],
,Among former/current writers are:
,
,Jessica Davis,[11],
,Scott Ferguson, former Editor in Chief of eWeek, 2006 - 2012 (when eWeek stopped their print edition ""and eWeek became an all-digital publication"").,[3],
,Todd Weiss, Senior Writer (""all things mobile""),[12],
,Influence,[,edit,],
,A famous part of ,PCWeek, was the fictional gossip columnist by the name of ""Spencer F. Katt"".  The column would cover all sorts of rumors and gossip about the PC Industry, and the character of Spencer F. Katt became a famous icon of the entire world of computing.,[13],[14],
,PCWeek, had influence on the PC Industry that it covered and the success of business PCs contributed to the success of ,PCWeek,. John Pallatto characterizes the rise of PCs in 1985 as a ""social phenomenon"", and says that ""the most sought-after status symbol on Wall Street in 1985... was the key to unlock the power switch on an IBM PC AT"".
,PCWeek, was licensed in other countries, notably Australia, where it was first published by ,Australian Consolidated Press,. Towards the end of the 1990s, the title shifted to a publishing partnership between Ziff-Davis and Australian Provincial Newspapers where its final Australian editor was Paul Zucker.
,One story from ,PCWeek, that is well known is their coverage of ""the famous 1994 flaw in the numerical processor in Intel's Pentium chip"".  The news they broke on Intel's processor, along with other research, caused Intel to actually pull back and fix their chips before offering new ones.,[5],  
,Current editor in chief Chris Preimesberger, who joined eWEEK in 2005 as a free-lancer, now runs a staff consisting of mostly free-lancers, many of whom have worked full time for eWEEK in the past and at other IT publications. The readership has been loyal through the years and now consists mostly of veteran IT professionals, company executives, software developers, investors and other people interested in the ebb and flow of the IT business and trends in products and services.
,
,Training,[,edit,],
,After 14 years at PC week, Sam Whitmore started his own firm (Media Survey). The latter, after over 2 decades, began a fellowship to train future reporters.,[6],

,The ,Allgemeiner Deutscher Fahrrad-Club, (,ADFC,) (German Cyclist’s Association,[3],) is a registered ,cycling association, and club for ,cyclists, in Germany.
,
,
,History,[,edit,],
,The founding meeting of the ADFC took place on 27 September 1979 in ,Bremen,, after the idea to establish such an organisation arose during the ,International Bicycle and Motorbike Exhibition, (IFMA) on 18 April 1978. Jan Tebbe from Bremen provided the idea and was the first chairman of the ADFC. Other founders were planing and mobility scientists like Heiner Monheim or Tilman Bracher.
,The ADFC is an interest group of cyclists in German towns, particularly in mobility policy. It became known for the bicycle climate test, which was carried out in 1988, 1991, 2003, 2005 and 2012.
,The ADFC is a member of the ,European Cyclists' Federation, and the ,International Mountain Bicycling Association,. At the demand of the ADFC a National Cycle Traffic Plan was presented in 2002 for the first time by the ,Cabinet of Germany,.
,
,Activities,[,edit,],
,Theft prevention,[,edit,],
,In some regions, the ADFC offers ,bicycle coding,, coordinated with the police (FEIN coding). The ADFC advises in matters of theft prevention, secure bicycle parking facilities, and locks.
,
,Cycle tours,[,edit,],
,The local and district associations of the ADFC offer members and non-members throughout Germany cycle tours of varying difficulty and duration. The programmes are available from the groups and increasingly on the Internet.
,
,Action,[,edit,],
,""Mit dem Rad zur Arbeit"" (""Cycling to Work""): Nationally exclusive with ,public health insurance,, the campaign motivates employees to travel to work by bike, and to encourage companies to create favourable conditions to this end, e.g. showers or parking facilities. Aims are preventive health care and the reduction of motorised individual transport.

,The ,Dachgeber, (""roof giver"") is a sub-organization of the ADFC and a ,hospitality exchange service,, which mediates on a basis of mutual free accommodation for cyclists on tour. Dachgeber is issued by the traffic educator, bicycle technician and bicycle travel expert of ADFC, Wolfgang Reiche.,[4], The hosts are members of ADFC and provide accommodation free of charge on a reciprocal basis, which by rule only includes a place to sleep for the air mattress to be brought along.,[5], Dachgeber was created in 1987 as a result of a global bicycle journey that lasted four years.,[6], Dachgeber is a non-profit project and lists 3.200 hosts.,[6],
,
,Travel,[,edit,],
,The subdivisions of the ADFC also function as tour operators. State, district and local associations offer guided cycle tours of several days, in addition the ADFC brokers cycling holidays. In 1995 the quality certification ""Bed & Bike."" was started. Bed & Bike undertakings are guest establishments from five star hotel to youth hostel and camping site, which commit themselves to cater for the expectations of cycle tourists. 
Since 2006, ADFC tests and certifies long-distance cycle paths as ,ADFC Quality Routes, (""ADFC-Qualitätsradroute"") according to criteria developed by the tourism expert committee. In August 2008 the top mark of five stars was assigned for the first time to a long-distance cycle route: the Main Valley Cycle Route near Randersacker.
,
,Consulting,[,edit,],
,In rented information centres the ADFC offers advice on topics concerning bicycle and traffic, gives tips on cycle holidays, helps with the planning of tours, and lends books, magazines, bikes and accessories. With its programme ""Bike + Business"", ADFC of Hesse advises firms and administrations on the creation of cycle-friendly conditions for their staff.
,
,Maps,[,edit,],
,ADFC is involved in the publication of a bicycle map series on a scale of 1:150.000 (according to the publisher’s imprint Germany’s most purchased cycle tour map) as well as of regional maps on a scale of 1:75.000 (occasionally also 1:100.000 or 1:50.000) and often creates bike maps right up to bicycle town plans following the slogan ""from cyclists for cyclists."" They offer courses and information on GPS navigation.
,
,Literature,[,edit,],
,Members receive the magazine ""Radwelt"" every two months, and other regional bicycle magazines, as well as their tour programme in paper form.
,

ADFC Berlin organizes the converging bicycle rally, which according to their own assessment is the largest ,bicycle demonstration, in the world.
,
,Data,[,edit,],

,State Associations: 16,
,District Associations: around 400,
,Committees offices and info centres: around 60,
,Managing Committee,[,edit,],

,Committees,[,edit,],
,Federal structure,: The ADFC is structured federally. In addition to the Federal Association there are state and district associations. The local associations form the lowest level. With Federal Board, Federal General Assembly and Federal Central Committee the association is built up in a similar way to the German government (Analogy: Bundestag and Federal Assembly).,
,Delegate principle,: Each level elects, besides its own managing committees, delegates who decide the managing committee of the next highest level. So for instance the delegates of a Federal State Assembly elect the participants of the Federal General Assembly. This in turn determines the Federal Board.,
,The voluntary working ,Federal Board, is elected by the Federal General Assembly. For the implementation of its decisions the managing committee can draw on the federal office in Bremen.,
,The ,Federal General Assembly., is the highest committee of the association, which holds an annual meeting and elects the Federal Board for two years. The basic decisions on the aims and the focus of the association’s work are as a rule made in this committee.,
,The ,Federal Central Committee, is composed of representatives from the state associations (as a rule members of the state executive committee) and determines the guidelines for the work of the Federal Board. Thus the central committee is the second highest committee of the ADFC.,
,Expert committees, advise the Federal Board on the development of ADFC positions. Expert committees are appointed and dissolved by the General Assembly at the suggestion of the central committee. There are exist expert committees on technology, tourism, public transport and cycle traffic. The cycle traffic expert group is a joint commission of the ADFC and the union for urban, regional and state planning.,

,Facebook, is a ,social media, and ,social networking service, owned by the American technology conglomerate ,Meta,. Created in 2004 by ,Mark Zuckerberg, with four other ,Harvard College, students and roommates ,Eduardo Saverin,, ,Andrew McCollum,, ,Dustin Moskovitz,, and ,Chris Hughes,, its name derives from the ,face book, directories often given to American university students. Membership was initially limited to Harvard students, gradually expanding to other North American universities. Since 2006, Facebook allows everyone to register from 13 years old, except in the case of a handful of nations, where the age limit is 14 years.,[6], As of December 2022,[update],, Facebook claimed almost 3 billion monthly active users.,[7], As of October 2023, Facebook ranked as the ,3rd most visited website in the world,, with 22.56% of its traffic coming from the United States.,[8],[9], It was the most downloaded ,mobile app, of the 2010s.,[10],
,Facebook can be accessed from devices with ,Internet, connectivity, such as ,personal computers,, ,tablets, and ,smartphones,. After registering, users can create a profile revealing information about themselves. They can post text, photos and multimedia which are shared with any other users who have agreed to be their ,friend, or, with different ,privacy settings,, publicly. Users can also ,communicate directly, with each other with ,Messenger,, join common-interest groups, and receive notifications on the activities of their Facebook friends and the pages they follow.

,2003–2006: Thefacebook, Thiel investment, and name change,
,Original layout and name of ,Thefacebook, in 2004, showing ,Al Pacino,'s face superimposed with ,binary numbers, as Facebook's original logo, designed by co-founder Andrew McCollum,[14],
,Zuckerberg built a website called ""Facemash"" in 2003 while attending ,Harvard University,. The site was comparable to ,Hot or Not, and used ""photos compiled from the online ,face books, of nine Houses, placing two next to each other at a time and asking users to choose the 'hotter' person"".,[15], Facemash attracted 450 visitors and 22,000 photo-views in its first four hours.,[16], The site was sent to several campus group ,listservs,, but was shut down a few days later by Harvard administration. Zuckerberg faced expulsion and was charged with breaching security, violating ,copyrights, and violating individual privacy. Ultimately, the charges were dropped.,[15], Zuckerberg expanded on this project that semester by creating a social study tool. He uploaded art images, each accompanied by a comments section, to a website he shared with his classmates.,[17],
,A "",face book,"" is a student directory featuring photos and personal information.,[16], In 2003, Harvard had only a paper version,[18], along with private online directories.,[15],[19], Zuckerberg told ,The Harvard Crimson,, ""Everyone's been talking a lot about a universal face book within Harvard. ... I think it's kind of silly that it would take the University a couple of years to get around to it. I can do it better than they can, and I can do it in a week."",[19], In January 2004, Zuckerberg coded a new website, known as ""TheFacebook"", inspired by a ,Crimson, editorial about Facemash, stating, ""It is clear that the technology needed to create a centralized Website is readily available ... the benefits are many."" Zuckerberg met with Harvard student ,Eduardo Saverin,, and each of them agreed to invest $1,000 ($1,613 in 2023 dollars,[20],) in the site.,[21], On February 4, 2004, Zuckerberg launched ""TheFacebook"", originally located at thefacebook.com.,[22],
,
,Mark Zuckerberg,, co-creator of Facebook, in his ,Harvard, dorm room, 2005,
,Six days after the site launched, Harvard seniors ,Cameron Winklevoss,, ,Tyler Winklevoss,, and ,Divya Narendra, accused Zuckerberg of intentionally misleading them into believing that he would help them build a social network called ,HarvardConnection.com,. They claimed that he was instead using their ideas to build a competing product.,[23], The three complained to the ,Crimson, and the newspaper began an investigation. They later sued Zuckerberg, settling in 2008,[24], for 1.2 million ,shares, (worth $300 million at Facebook's ,IPO,, or $398 million in 2023 dollars,[20],).,[25],
,Membership was initially restricted to students of ,Harvard College,. Within a month, more than half the undergraduates had registered.,[26], ,Dustin Moskovitz,, ,Andrew McCollum,, and ,Chris Hughes, joined Zuckerberg to help manage the growth of the website.,[27], In March 2004, Facebook expanded to ,Columbia,, ,Stanford, and ,Yale,.,[28], It then became available to all ,Ivy League, colleges, ,Boston University,, ,NYU,, ,MIT,, and successively most universities in the United States and ,Canada,.,[29],[30],

However, Reid Hoffman was too busy launching ,LinkedIn, so he set Facebook up with ,PayPal, co-founder ,Peter Thiel,, who gave Facebook its first investment later that month.,[33],[34], In 2005, the company dropped ""the"" from its name after purchasing the ,domain name, Facebook.com for ,US$,200,000 ($312,012 in 2023 dollars,[20],).,[35], The domain had belonged to AboutFace Corporation.
,In May 2005, ,Accel Partners, invested $12.7 million ($19.8 million in 2023 dollars,[20],) in Facebook, and ,Jim Breyer,[36], added $1 million ($1.56 million in 2023 dollars,[20],) of his own money.

,In October 2021, owner Facebook, Inc. changed its company name to ,Meta Platforms, Inc.,, or simply ""Meta"", as it shifts its focus to building the "",metaverse,"". This change does not affect the name of the Facebook social networking service itself, instead being similar to the creation of ,Alphabet, as ,Google,'s parent company in 2015.,[209],
,In November 2021, Facebook stated it would stop targeting ads based on data related to health, race, ethnicity, political beliefs, religion and sexual orientation. The change will occur in January and will affect all apps owned by Meta Platforms.,[210],
,In February 2022, Facebook's daily active users dropped for the first time in its 18-year history. According to Facebook's parent Meta, DAUs dropped to 1.929 billion in the three months ending in December, down from 1.930 billion the previous quarter. Furthermore, the company warned that revenue growth would slow due to competition from TikTok and YouTube, as well as advertisers cutting back on spending.,[211],
,On March 10, 2022, Facebook announced that it will temporarily ease rules to allow violent speech against 'Russian invaders'.,[212], Russia then banned all Meta services, including ,Instagram,.,[213],
,In September 2022, Jonathan Vanian, a Technology Reporter for CNBC, wrote a piece on CNBC.com about the recent struggles Facebook was experiencing, writing 
""Users are jumping ship and advertisers are reducing their spending, leaving Meta poised to report its second straight drop in quarterly revenue."" He also cited poor leadership decisions devoting resources to the metaverse, writing ""CEO Mark Zuckerberg spends much of his time proselytizing the metaverse, which may be the company's future but accounts for virtually none of its near-term revenue and is costing billions of dollars a year to build."" 
He also detailed accounts from analysts predicting a ""death spiral"" for Facebook stock as users leave, ad impressions increase, and the company chases revenue.,[214],

,October 4, 2021, global service outage,
,Main article: ,2021 Facebook outage,
,Traffic volume for Facebook services on October 4, 2021, with a drop during the global outage.,
,On October 4, 2021, Facebook had its worst outage since 2008. The outage was global in scope, and took down all Facebook properties, including ,Instagram, and WhatsApp, from approximately 15:39 UTC to 22:05 UTC, and affected roughly three billion users.,[215],[216],[217], Security experts identified the problem as a ,BGP, withdrawal of all of the ,IP, routes to their ,Domain Name (DNS) servers, which were all self-hosted at the time.,[218],[219], The outage also affected all internal communications systems used by Facebook employees, which disrupted restoration efforts.,[219],
,The outage cut off Facebook's internal communications, preventing employees from sending or receiving external emails, accessing the corporate directory, and authenticating to some ,Google Docs, and ,Zoom, services.,[220],[221], The outage had a major impact on people in the ,developing world,, who depend on Facebook's "",Free Basics,"" program, affecting communication, business and humanitarian work.,[222],[223],[224],
,Facebook's chief technology officer, ,Mike Schroepfer,, wrote an apology after the downtime had extended to several hours,,[225],[226], saying, ""Teams are working as fast as possible to debug and restore as fast as possible."",[227],
,
,Shutdown of facial recognition,
,On November 2, 2021, Facebook announced it would shut down its facial recognition technology and delete the data on over a billion users.,[228], Meta later announced plans to implement the technology as well as other biometric systems in its future products, such as the ,metaverse,.,[229],
,The shutdown of the technology will reportedly also stop Facebook's automated alt text system, used to transcribe media on the platform for visually impaired users.,[229],
,In February 2023, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced that Meta would start selling blue ""verified"" badges on Instagram and Facebook.,[230],
,
,Features,
,Facebook posts can have an unlimited number of characters. They can also have images and videos.
,Users can ""friend"" users, both sides must agree to being friends. Post can be changed to be seen by everyone (public), friends, people in a certain group (group) or by selected friends (private).
,Users can also join groups. Groups are composed of persons with shared interests.  For example, they might go to the same sporting club, live in the same suburb, have the same breed of pet or share a hobby. Posts posted in a group can be seen only by those in a group, unless set to public.
,Users can also buy, sell or swap things on Facebook Marketplace or in a Buy, Swap and Sell group.
,Facebook users can also advertise events on Facebook. Events advertised can be offline, on a website other than Facebook or on Facebook.

,Further information: ,List of Facebook features, and ,Facebook Platform,
,Profile shown on Thefacebook in 2005,
,Previous Facebook logo in use from August 23, 2005, until July 1, 2015,
,Technical aspects,
,The site's primary color is blue as Zuckerberg is ,red–green colorblind,, a realization that occurred after a test taken around 2007.,[231],[232], Facebook was initially built using ,PHP,, a popular scripting language designed for web development.,[233], PHP was used to create dynamic content and manage data on the server side of the Facebook application. Zuckerberg and co-founders chose PHP for its simplicity and ease of use, which allowed them to quickly develop and deploy the initial version of Facebook. As Facebook grew in user base and functionality, the company encountered scalability and performance challenges with PHP. In response, Facebook engineers developed tools and technologies to optimize PHP performance. One of the most significant was the creation of the HipHop Virtual Machine (,HHVM,). This significantly improved the performance and efficiency of PHP code execution on Facebook's servers.
,
,2012 architecture,
,Facebook is developed as one monolithic application. According to an interview in 2012 with Facebook build engineer Chuck Rossi, Facebook compiles into a 1.5 GB binary blob which is then distributed to the servers using a custom ,BitTorrent,-based release system. Rossi stated that it takes about 15 minutes to build and 15 minutes to release to the servers. The build and release process has zero downtime. Changes to Facebook are rolled out daily.,[234],
,Facebook used a combination platform based on ,HBase, to store data across distributed machines. Using a tailing architecture, events are stored in log files, and the logs are tailed. The system rolls these events up and writes them to storage. The user interface then pulls the data out and displays it to users. Facebook handles requests as ,AJAX, behavior. These requests are written to a log file using ,Scribe, (developed by Facebook).,[235],
,Data is read from these log files using Ptail, an internally built tool to aggregate data from multiple Scribe stores. It tails the log files and pulls data out. Ptail data are separated into three streams and sent to clusters in different ,data centers, (Plugin impression, News feed impressions, Actions (plugin + news feed)). Puma is used to manage periods of high data flow (Input/Output or IO). Data is processed in batches to lessen the number of times needed to read and write under high demand periods. (A hot article generates many impressions and news feed impressions that cause huge data skews.) Batches are taken every 1.5 seconds, limited by memory used when creating a ,hash table,.,[235],
,Data is then output in PHP format. The backend is written in ,Java,. Thrift is used as the messaging format so PHP programs can query Java services. Caching solutions display pages more quickly. The data is then sent to ,MapReduce, servers where it is queried via Hive. This serves as a backup as the data can be recovered from Hive.,[235],
,
,Content delivery network (CDN),
,Facebook uses its own ,content delivery network, or ""edge network"" under the domain fbcdn.net for serving static data.,[236],[237], Until the mid-2010s, Facebook also relied on ,Akamai, for CDN services.,[238],[239],[240],
,
,Hack programming language,
,On March 20, 2014, Facebook announced a new open-source programming language called ,Hack,. Before public release, a large portion of Facebook was already running and ""battle tested"" using the new language.,[241],
,
,User profile/personal timeline,
,Facebook login/signup screen,
,Each registered user on Facebook has a personal profile that shows their posts and content.,[242], The format of individual user pages was revamped in September 2011 and became known as ""Timeline"", a chronological feed of a user's stories,,[243],[244], including status updates, photos, interactions with apps and events.,[245], The layout let users add a ""cover photo"".,[245], Users were given more privacy settings.,[245], In 2007, Facebook launched Facebook Pages for brands and celebrities to interact with their fanbases.,[246],[247], 100,000 Pages,[,further explanation needed,], launched in November.,[248], In June 2009, Facebook introduced a ""Usernames"" feature, allowing users to choose a unique nickname used in the ,URL, for their personal profile, for easier sharing.,[249],[250],
,In February 2014, Facebook expanded the gender setting, adding a custom input field that allows users to choose from a wide range of gender identities. Users can also set which set of gender-specific pronoun should be used in reference to them throughout the site.,[251],[252],[253], In May 2014, Facebook introduced a feature to allow users to ask for information not disclosed by other users on their profiles. If a user does not provide key information, such as location, hometown, or relationship status, other users can use a new ""ask"" button to send a message asking about that item to the user in a single click.,[254],[255],
,
,News Feed,
,Further information: ,News Feed,
,News Feed, appears on every user's homepage and highlights information including profile changes, upcoming events and friends' birthdays.,[256], This enabled spammers and other users to manipulate these features by creating illegitimate events or posting fake birthdays to attract attention to their profile or cause.,[257], Initially, the News Feed caused dissatisfaction among Facebook users; some complained it was too cluttered and full of undesired information, others were concerned that it made it too easy for others to track individual activities (such as relationship status changes, events, and conversations with other users).,[258], Zuckerberg apologized for the site's failure to include appropriate privacy features. Users then gained control over what types of information are shared automatically with friends. Users are now able to prevent user-set categories of friends from seeing updates about certain types of activities, including profile changes, Wall posts and newly added friends.,[259],
,On February 23, 2010, Facebook was granted a patent,[260], on certain aspects of its News Feed. The patent covers News Feeds in which links are provided so that one user can participate in the activity of another user.,[261], The sorting and display of stories in a user's News Feed is governed by the ,EdgeRank, algorithm.,[262],
,The ,Photos, application allows users to upload albums and photos.,[263], Each album can contain 200 photos.,[264], Privacy settings apply to individual albums. Users can "",tag,"", or label, friends in a photo. The friend receives a notification about the tag with a link to the photo.,[265], This photo tagging feature was developed by Aaron Sittig, now a Design Strategy Lead at Facebook, and former Facebook engineer Scott Marlette back in 2006 and was only granted a ,patent, in 2011.,[266],[267],
,On June 7, 2012, Facebook launched its App Center to help users find games and other applications.,[268],
,On May 13, 2015, Facebook in association with major news portals launched ""Instant Articles"" to provide news on the Facebook news feed without leaving the site.,[269],[270],
,In January 2017, Facebook launched Facebook Stories for iOS and Android in Ireland. The feature, following the format of ,Snapchat, and Instagram stories, allows users to upload photos and videos that appear above friends' and followers' News Feeds and disappear after 24 hours.,[271],
,On October 11, 2017, Facebook introduced the ,3D Posts, feature to allow for uploading interactive 3D assets.,[272], On January 11, 2018, Facebook announced that it would change News Feed to prioritize friends/family content and de-emphasize content from media companies.,[273],
,In February 2020, Facebook announced it would spend $1 billion ($1.18 billion in 2023 dollars,[20],) to license news material from publishers for the next three years; a pledge coming as the company falls under scrutiny from governments across the globe over not paying for news content appearing on the platform. The pledge would be in addition to the $600 million ($706 million in 2023 dollars,[20],) paid since 2018 through deals with news companies such as ,The Guardian, and ,Financial Times,.,[274],[275],[276],
,In March and April 2021, in response to Apple announcing changes to its iOS device's ,Identifier for Advertisers, policy, which included requiring app developers to directly request to users the ability to track on an opt-in basis, Facebook purchased full-page newspaper advertisements attempting to convince users to allow tracking, highlighting the effects targeted ads have on small businesses.,[277], Facebook's efforts were ultimately unsuccessful, as Apple released iOS 14.5 in late April 2021, containing the feature for users in what has been deemed ""App Tracking Transparency"". Moreover, statistics from ,Verizon Communications, subsidiary Flurry Analytics show 96% of all iOS users in the United States are not permitting tracking at all, and only 12% of worldwide iOS users are allowing tracking, which some news outlets deem ""Facebook's nightmare"", among similar terms.,[278],[279],[280],[281], Despite the news, Facebook has stated that the new policy and software update would be ""manageable"".,[282],

,Like button,
,Further information: ,Facebook like button,
,Human billboard advertising Facebook Canberra in the City page at the ,National Multicultural Festival,The ""like"" button, stylized as a ""thumbs up"" icon, was first enabled on February 9, 2009,,[283], and enables users to easily interact with status updates, comments, photos and videos, links shared by friends, and advertisements. Once clicked by a user, the designated content is more likely to appear in friends' ,News Feeds,.,[284],[285], The button displays the number of other users who have liked the content.,[286], The like button was extended to comments in June 2010.,[287], In February 2016, Facebook expanded Like into ""Reactions"", choosing among five pre-defined emotions, including ""Love"", ""Haha"", ""Wow"", ""Sad"", or ""Angry"".,[288],[289],[290],[291], In late April 2020, during the ,COVID-19 pandemic,, a new ""Care"" reaction was added.,[292],
,Instant messaging,
,Main article: ,Facebook Messenger,
,Facebook Messenger is an ,instant messaging, service and software application. It began as Facebook Chat in 2008,,[293], was revamped in 2010,[294], and eventually became a standalone mobile app in August 2011, while remaining part of the user page on browsers.,[295],
,Complementing regular conversations, Messenger lets users make one-to-one,[296], and group,[297], ,voice,[298], and ,video calls,.,[299], Its Android app has integrated support for ,SMS,[300], and ""Chat Heads"", which are round profile photo icons appearing on-screen regardless of what app is open,,[301], while both apps support multiple accounts,,[302], conversations with optional ,end-to-end encryption,[303], and ""Instant Games"".,[304], Some features, including sending money,[305], and requesting transportation,,[306], are limited to the United States.,[305], In 2017, Facebook added ""Messenger Day"", a feature that lets users share photos and videos in a story-format with all their friends with the content disappearing after 24 hours;,[307], Reactions, which lets users tap and hold a message to add a reaction through an ,emoji,;,[308], and Mentions, which lets users in group conversations type @ to give a particular user a notification.,[308],
,In April 2020, Facebook began rolling out a new feature called ,Messenger Rooms,, a video chat feature that allows users to chat with up to 50 people at a time.,[309], In July 2020, Facebook added a new feature in Messenger that lets iOS users to use Face ID or Touch ID to lock their chats. The feature is called App Lock and is a part of several changes in Messenger regarding privacy and security.,[310],[311], On October 13, 2020, the Messenger application introduced cross-app messaging with Instagram, which was launched in September 2021.,[312], In addition to the integrated messaging, the application announced the introduction of a new logo, which will be an amalgamation of the Messenger and Instagram logo.,[313],
,Businesses and users can interact through Messenger with features such as tracking purchases and receiving notifications, and interacting with customer service representatives. Third-party developers can integrate apps into Messenger, letting users enter an app while inside Messenger and optionally share details from the app into a chat.,[314], Developers can build ,chatbots, into Messenger, for uses such as news publishers building bots to distribute news.,[315], The ,M virtual assistant, (U.S.) scans chats for keywords and suggests relevant actions, such as its payments system for users mentioning money.,[316],[317], Group chatbots appear in Messenger as ""Chat Extensions"". A ""Discovery"" tab allows finding bots, and enabling special, branded ,QR codes, that, when scanned, take the user to a specific bot.,[318],
,
,Privacy policy,
,See also: ,§ Privacy,
,Facebook's data policy outlines its policies for collecting, storing, and sharing user's data.,[319], Facebook enables users to control access to individual posts and their profile,[320], through ,privacy settings,.,[321], The user's name and profile picture (if applicable) are public.
,Facebook's revenue depends on targeted advertising, which involves analyzing user data to decide which ads to show each user. Facebook buys data from third parties, gathered from both online and offline sources, to supplement its own data on users. Facebook maintains that it does not share data used for targeted advertising with the advertisers themselves.,[322], The company states:
,
,""We provide advertisers with reports about the kinds of people seeing their ads and how their ads are performing, but we don't share information that personally identifies you (information such as your name or email address that by itself can be used to contact you or identifies who you are) unless you give us permission. For example, we provide general demographic and interest information to advertisers (for example, that an ad was seen by a woman between the ages of 25 and 34 who lives in Madrid and likes software engineering) to help them better understand their audience. We also confirm which Facebook ads led you to make a purchase or take an action with an advertiser."",[319],
,As of October 2021,[update],, Facebook claims it uses the following policy for sharing user data with third parties:
,
,Apps, websites, and third-party integrations on or using our Products.
,When you choose to use third-party apps, websites, or other services that use, or are integrated with, our Products, they can receive information about what you post or share. For example, when you play a game with your Facebook friends or use a Facebook Comment or Share button on a website, the game developer or website can receive information about your activities in the game or receive a comment or link that you share from the website on Facebook. Also, when you download or use such third-party services, they can access your public profile on Facebook, and any information that you share with them. Apps and websites you use may receive your list of Facebook friends if you choose to share it with them. But apps and websites you use will not be able to receive any other information about your Facebook friends from you, or information about any of your Instagram followers (although your friends and followers may, of course, choose to share this information themselves). Information collected by these third-party services is subject to their own terms and policies, not this one.
,Devices and operating systems providing native versions of Facebook and Instagram (i.e. where we have not developed our own first-party apps) will have access to all information you choose to share with them, including information your friends share with you, so they can provide our core functionality to you.
,
Note: We are in the process of restricting developers' data access even further to help prevent abuse. For example, we will remove developers' access to your Facebook and Instagram data if you haven't used their app in 3 months, and we are changing Login, so that in the next version, we will reduce the data that an app can request without app review to include only name, Instagram username and bio, profile photo and email address. Requesting any other data will require our approval.,[319],
,Facebook will also share data with ,law enforcement, if needed to.,[319],
,Facebook's policies have changed repeatedly since the service's debut, amid a series of controversies covering everything from how well it secures user data, to what extent it allows users to control access, to the kinds of access given to third parties, including businesses, political campaigns and governments. These facilities vary according to country, as some nations require the company to make data available (and limit access to services), while the European Union's ,GDPR, regulation mandates additional privacy protections.,[323],
,
,Bug Bounty Program,
,A Facebook "",White Hat,"" debit card, given to researchers who report ,security bugs,
,On July 29, 2011, Facebook announced its Bug Bounty Program that paid security researchers a minimum of $500 ($677.00 in 2023 dollars,[20],) for reporting security holes. The company promised not to pursue ""white hat"" hackers who identified such problems.,[324],[325], This led researchers in many countries to participate, particularly in India and Russia.,[326],
,
,Reception,
,Userbase,
,Facebook's rapid growth began as soon as it became available and continued through 2018, before beginning to decline.
,Facebook passed 100 million registered users in 2008,,[327], and 500 million in July 2010.,[69], According to the company's data at the July 2010 announcement, half of the site's membership used Facebook daily, for an average of 34 minutes, while 150 million users accessed the site by mobile.,[70],
,In October 2012, Facebook's monthly active users passed one billion,,[96],[328], with 600 million mobile users, 219 billion photo uploads, and 140 billion friend connections.,[97], The 2 billion user mark was crossed in June 2017.,[329],[330],
,In November 2015, after skepticism about the accuracy of its ""monthly active users"" measurement, Facebook changed its definition to a logged-in member who visits the Facebook site through the web browser or mobile app, or uses the ,Facebook Messenger, app, in the 30-day period prior to the measurement. This excluded the use of third-party services with Facebook integration, which was previously counted.,[331],
,From 2017 to 2019, the percentage of the U.S. population over the age of 12 who use Facebook has declined, from 67% to 61% (a decline of some 15 million U.S. users), with a higher drop-off among younger Americans (a decrease in the percentage of U.S. 12- to 34-year-olds who are users from 58% in 2015 to 29% in 2019).,[332],[333], The decline coincided with an increase in the popularity of Instagram, which is also owned by Meta.,[332],[333],
,The number of daily active users experienced a quarterly decline for the first time in the last quarter of 2021, down to 1.929 billion from 1.930 billion,,[334], but increased again the next quarter despite being banned in Russia.,[335],
,Historically, commentators have offered predictions of Facebook's decline or end, based on causes such as a declining user base;,[336], the legal difficulties of being a ,closed platform,, inability to generate revenue, inability to offer user privacy, inability to adapt to mobile platforms, or Facebook ending itself to present a next generation replacement;,[337], or Facebook's role in ,Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections,.,[338],

,""I don't believe private companies should make all of the decisions on their own. That's why we have advocated for updated internet regulations for several years now. I have testified in Congress multiple times and asked them to update these regulations. I've written op-eds outlining the areas of regulation we think are most important related to elections, harmful content, privacy, and competition.""

,
,—Mark Zuckerberg, responding to ,Frances Haugen,'s revelations (2021).,[349],
,
,Facebook's importance and scale has led to criticisms in many domains. Issues include ,Internet privacy,, excessive retention of user information,,[350], its ,facial recognition, software, ,DeepFace,[351],[352], its addictive quality,[353], and its role in the workplace, including employer access to employee accounts.,[354],
,Facebook has been criticized for electricity usage,,[355], tax avoidance,,[356], real-name user requirement policies,,[357], censorship,[358],[359], and its involvement in the United States ,PRISM surveillance program,.,[360], According to ,The Express Tribune,, Facebook ""avoided billions of dollars in tax using offshore companies"".,[361],
,Facebook is alleged to have harmful psychological effects on its users, including feelings of jealousy,[362],[363], and stress,,[364],[365], a lack of attention,[366], and ,social media addiction,.,[367],[368], According to Kaufmann et al., mothers' motivations for using social media are often related to their social and mental health.,[369], European antitrust regulator ,Margrethe Vestager, stated that Facebook's terms of service relating to private data were ""unbalanced"".,[370],
,Facebook has been criticized for allowing users to publish illegal or offensive material. Specifics include ,copyright, and ,intellectual property, infringement,,[371], ,hate speech,,,[372],[373], incitement of rape,[374], and terrorism,,[375],[376], ,fake news,,,[377],[378],[379], and crimes, murders, and livestreaming violent incidents.,[380],[381],[382], Commentators have accused Facebook of willingly facilitating the spread of such content.,[383],[384],[385], ,Sri Lanka, blocked both Facebook and WhatsApp in May 2019 after ,anti-Muslim riots,, the worst in the country since the ,Easter Sunday bombing, in the same year as a temporary measure to maintain peace in Sri Lanka.,[386],[387],
Facebook removed 3 billion fake accounts only during the last quarter of 2018 and the first quarter of 2019;,[388], in comparison, the social network reports 2.39 billion monthly active users.,[388],
,In late July 2019, the company announced it was under ,antitrust, investigation by the ,Federal Trade Commission,.,[389],
,The consumer advocacy group, Which?, claims that individuals are still utilizing Facebook to set up fraudulent five-star ratings for various products. The group has identified 14 communities that exchange reviews for either money or complimentary items such as watches, earbuds, and sprinklers.,[390],
,
,Privacy,
,Main article: ,Privacy concerns with Facebook,
,See also: ,Privacy concerns with social networking services § Facebook,
,Facebook has experienced a steady stream of controversies over how it handles user privacy, repeatedly adjusting its privacy settings and policies.,[391],
,Since 2009, Facebook has been participating in the PRISM secret program, sharing with the US ,National Security Agency, audio, video, photographs, e-mails, documents and connection logs from user profiles, among other social media services.,[392],[393],
,On November 29, 2011, Facebook settled ,Federal Trade Commission, charges that it deceived consumers by failing to keep privacy promises.,[394], In August 2013 ,High-Tech Bridge, published a study showing that links included in Facebook messaging service messages were being accessed by Facebook.,[395], In January 2014 two users filed a lawsuit against Facebook alleging that their privacy had been violated by this practice.,[396],
,On June 7, 2018, Facebook announced that a bug had resulted in about 14 million Facebook users having their default sharing setting for all new posts set to ""public"".,[397],
,On April 4, 2019, half a billion records of Facebook users were found exposed on ,Amazon, cloud servers, containing information about users' friends, likes, groups, and checked-in locations, as well as names, passwords and email addresses.,[398],
,The phone numbers of at least 200 million Facebook users were found to be exposed on an open online database in September 2019. They included 133 million US users, 18 million from the UK, and 50 million from users in ,Vietnam,. After removing duplicates, the 419 million records have been reduced to 219 million. The database went offline after TechCrunch contacted the web host. It is thought the records were amassed using a tool that Facebook disabled in April 2018 after the ,Cambridge Analytica, controversy. A Facebook spokeswoman said in a statement: ""The dataset is old and appears to have information obtained before we made changes last year...There is no evidence that Facebook accounts were compromised."",[399],
,Facebook's privacy problems resulted in companies like ,Viber Media, and ,Mozilla, discontinuing advertising on Facebook's platforms.,[400],[401],
,In March 2024, a court in California released documents detailing Facebook's 2016 ""Project Ghostbusters"". The project was aimed at helping Facebook compete with ,Snapchat, and involved Facebook trying to develop decryption tools to collect, decrypt, and analyze traffic that users generated when visiting Snapchat and, eventually, YouTube and Amazon. The company eventually used its tool ,Onavo, to initiate man-in-the-middle attacks and read users' traffic before it was encrypted.,[402],
,
,Racial bias,
,Facebook was accused of committing ""systemic"" racial bias by EEOC based on the complaints of three rejected candidates and a current employee of the company. The three rejected employees along with the Operational Manager at Facebook as of March 2021 accused the firm of discriminating against Black people. The EEOC has initiated an investigation into the case.,[403],
,
,Shadow profiles,
,A "",shadow profile,"" refers to the data Facebook collects about individuals without their explicit permission. For example, the ,""like"" button, that appears on third-party websites allows the company to collect information about an individual's internet browsing habits, even if the individual is not a Facebook user.,[404],[405], Data can also be collected by other users. For example, a Facebook user can link their email account to their Facebook to find friends on the site, allowing the company to collect the email addresses of users and non-users alike.,[406], Over time, countless data points about an individual are collected; any single data point perhaps cannot identify an individual, but together allows the company to form a unique ""profile"".
,This practice has been criticized by those who believe people should be able to opt-out of involuntary data collection. Additionally, while Facebook users have the ability to download and inspect the data they provide to the site, data from the user's ""shadow profile"" is not included, and non-users of Facebook do not have access to this tool regardless. The company has also been unclear whether or not it is possible for a person to revoke Facebook's access to their ""shadow profile"".,[404],
,
,Cambridge Analytica,
,Main article: ,Facebook–Cambridge Analytica data scandal,
,Facebook customer Global Science Research sold information on over 87 million Facebook users to Cambridge Analytica, a political data analysis firm led by ,Alexander Nix,.,[407], While approximately 270,000 people used the app, Facebook's ,API, permitted data collection from their friends without their knowledge.,[408], At first Facebook downplayed the significance of the breach, and suggested that Cambridge Analytica no longer had access. Facebook then issued a statement expressing alarm and suspended Cambridge Analytica. Review of documents and interviews with former Facebook employees suggested that Cambridge Analytica still possessed the data.,[409], This was a violation of Facebook's ,consent decree, with the ,Federal Trade Commission,. This violation potentially carried a penalty of $40,000 ($48,534 in 2023 dollars,[20],) per occurrence, totalling trillions of dollars.,[410],
,According to ,The Guardian,, both Facebook and Cambridge Analytica threatened to sue the newspaper if it published the story. After publication, Facebook claimed that it had been ""lied to"". On March 23, 2018, The ,English High Court, granted an application by the ,Information Commissioner's Office, for a warrant to search Cambridge Analytica's London offices, ending a standoff between Facebook and the Information Commissioner over responsibility.,[411],
,On March 25, Facebook published a statement by Zuckerberg in major UK and US newspapers apologizing over a ""breach of trust"".,[412],

This was a breach of trust, and I'm sorry we didn't do more at the time. We're now taking steps to make sure this doesn't happen again.
,We've already stopped apps like this from getting so much information. Now we're limiting the data apps get when you sign in using Facebook.
,We're also investigating every single app that had access to large amounts of data before we fixed this. We expect there are others. And when we find them, we will ban them and tell everyone affected.
,Finally, we'll remind you which apps you've given access to your information – so you can shut off the ones you don't want anymore.
,
Thank you for believing in this community. I promise to do better for you.,
,On March 26, the ,Federal Trade Commission, opened an investigation into the matter.,[413], The controversy led Facebook to end its partnerships with data brokers who aid advertisers in targeting users.,[391],
,On April 24, 2019, Facebook said it could face a fine between $3 billion ($3.58 billion in 2023 dollars,[20],) to $5 billion ($5.96 billion in 2023 dollars,[20],) as the result of an investigation by the Federal Trade Commission.,[414], On July 24, 2019, the FTC fined Facebook $5 billion, the largest penalty ever imposed on a company for violating consumer privacy. Additionally, Facebook had to implement a new privacy structure, follow a 20-year settlement order, and allow the FTC to monitor Facebook.,[415], Cambridge Analytica's CEO and a developer faced restrictions on future business dealings and were ordered to destroy any personal information they collected. Cambridge Analytica filed for bankruptcy.,[416],
,Facebook also implemented additional privacy controls and settings,[417], in part to comply with the European Union's ,General Data Protection Regulation, (GDPR), which took effect in May.,[418], Facebook also ended its active opposition to the ,California Consumer Privacy Act,.,[419],
,Some, such as ,Meghan McCain, have drawn an equivalence between the use of data by Cambridge Analytica and the ,Barack Obama's 2012 campaign,, which, according to ,Investor's Business Daily,, ""encouraged supporters to download an Obama 2012 Facebook app that, when activated, let the campaign collect Facebook data both on users and their friends."",[420],[421],[422], Carol Davidsen, the Obama for America (OFA) former director of integration and media analytics, wrote that ""Facebook was surprised we were able to suck out the whole social graph, but they didn't stop us once they realised that was what we were doing"".,[421],[422], ,PolitiFact, has rated McCain's statements ""Half-True"", on the basis that ""in Obama's case, direct users knew they were handing over their data to a political campaign"" whereas with Cambridge Analytica, users thought they were only taking a personality quiz for academic purposes, and while the Obama campaign only used the data ""to have their supporters contact their most persuadable friends"", Cambridge Analytica ""targeted users, friends and lookalikes directly with digital ads."",[423],
,
,DataSpii,
,In July 2019, cybersecurity researcher Sam Jadali exposed a catastrophic data leak known as ,DataSpii, involving data provider DDMR and marketing intelligence company Nacho Analytics (NA).,[424],[425], Branding itself as the ""God mode for the internet,"" NA through DDMR, provided its members access to private Facebook photos and Facebook Messenger attachments including tax returns.,[426], DataSpii harvested data from millions of Chrome and Firefox users through compromised browser extensions.,[427], The NA website stated it collected data from millions of opt-in users. Jadali, along with journalists from ,Ars Technica, and ,The Washington Post,, interviewed impacted users, including a ,Washington Post, staff member. According to the interviews, the impacted users did not consent to such collection.
,DataSpii demonstrated how a compromised user exposed the data of others, including the private photos and Messenger attachments belonging to a Facebook user's network of friends.,[426],
,DataSpii exploited Facebook's practice of making private photos and Messenger attachments publicly accessible via unique URLs. To bolster security in this regard, Facebook appends query strings in the URLs so as to limit the period of accessibility.,[426], Nevertheless, NA provided real-time access to these unique URLs, which were intended to be secure. This allowed NA members to access the private content within the restricted time frame designated by Facebook.
,The Washington Post,',s Geoffrey Fowler, in collaboration with Jadali, opened Fowler's private Facebook photo in a browser with a compromised browser extension.,[424], Within minutes, they anonymously retrieved the ""private"" photo. To validate this proof-of-concept, they searched for Fowler's name using NA, which yielded his photo as a search result. In addition, Jadali discovered Fowler's ,Washington Post, colleague, Nick Mourtoupalas, was directly impacted by DataSpii.
,Jadali's investigation elucidated how DataSpii disseminated private data to additional third-parties, including foreign entities, within minutes of the data being acquired. In doing so, he identified the third-parties who were scraping, storing, and potentially enabling the facial-recognition of individuals in photos being furnished by DataSpii.,[428],
,
,Breaches,
,On September 28, 2018, Facebook experienced a major breach in its security, exposing the data of 50 million users. The data breach started in July 2017 and was discovered on September 16.,[429], Facebook notified users affected by the exploit and logged them out of their accounts.,[430],[431],
,In March 2019, Facebook confirmed a password compromise of millions of Facebook lite application users also affected millions of Instagram users. The reason cited was the storage of password as plain text instead of encryption which could be read by its employees.,[432],
,On December 19, 2019, security researcher Bob Diachenko discovered a database containing more than 267 million Facebook user IDs, phone numbers, and names that were left exposed on the web for anyone to access without a password or any other authentication.,[433],
,In February 2020, Facebook encountered a major ,security breach, in which its official ,Twitter, account was hacked by a ,Saudi Arabia,-based group called "",OurMine,"". The group has a history of actively exposing high-profile social media profiles' vulnerabilities.,[434],
,In April 2021, ,The Guardian, reported approximately half a billion users' data had been stolen including birthdates and phone numbers. Facebook alleged it was ""old data"" from a problem fixed in August 2019 despite the data's having been released a year and a half later only in 2021; it declined to speak with journalists, had apparently not notified regulators, called the problem ""unfixable"", and said it would not be advising users.,[435],
,
,Phone data and activity,
,Facebook acquired ,Onavo,'s ,virtual private network, to harvest usage data on its competitors.,
,After acquiring ,Onavo, in 2013, Facebook used its Onavo Protect ,virtual private network, (VPN) app to collect information on users' ,web traffic, and app usage. This allowed Facebook to monitor its competitors' performance, and motivated Facebook to acquire WhatsApp in 2014.,[436],[437],[438], Media outlets classified Onavo Protect as ,spyware,.,[439],[440],[441], In August 2018, Facebook removed the app in response to pressure from Apple, who asserted that it violated their guidelines.,[442],[443], The ,Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, sued Facebook on December 16, 2020, for ""false, misleading or deceptive conduct"" in response to the company's use of personal data obtained from Onavo for business purposes in contrast to Onavo's privacy-oriented marketing.,[444],[445],
,In 2016, Facebook Research launched Project Atlas, offering some users between the ages of 13 and 35 up to $20 per month ($25.00 in 2023 dollars,[20],) in exchange for their personal data, including their app usage, ,web browsing history,, ,web search, history, ,location history,, ,personal messages,, photos, videos, ,emails, and ,Amazon, order history.,[446],[447], In January 2019, ,TechCrunch, reported on the project. This led Apple to temporarily revoke Facebook's Enterprise Developer Program ,certificates, for one day, preventing Facebook Research from operating on iOS devices and disabling Facebook's internal iOS apps.,[447],[448],[449],
,Ars Technica, reported in April 2018 that the Facebook Android app had been harvesting user data, including phone calls and text messages, since 2015.,[450],[451],[452], In May 2018, several Android users filed a ,class action lawsuit, against Facebook for invading their privacy.,[453],[454],
,In January 2020, Facebook launched the Off-Facebook Activity page, which allows users to see information collected by Facebook about their non-Facebook activities.,[455], ,The Washington Post, columnist Geoffrey A. Fowler found that this included what other apps he used on his phone, even while the Facebook app was closed, what other web sites he visited on his phone, and what in-store purchases he made from affiliated businesses, even while his phone was completely off.,[456],
,In November 2021, a report was published by Fairplay, Global Action Plan and Reset Australia detailing accusations that Facebook was continuing to manage their ad targeting system with data collected from teen users.,[457], The accusations follow announcements by Facebook in July 2021 that they would cease ad targeting children.,[458],[459],
,
,Public apologies,
,The company first apologized for its privacy abuses in 2009.,[460],
,Facebook apologies have appeared in newspapers, television, blog posts and on Facebook.,[461], On March 25, 2018, leading US and UK newspapers published full-page ads with a personal apology from Zuckerberg. Zuckerberg issued a verbal apology on ,CNN,.,[462], In May 2010, he apologized for discrepancies in privacy settings.,[461],
,Previously, Facebook had its privacy settings spread out over 20 pages, and has now put all of its privacy settings on one page, which makes it more difficult for third-party apps to access the user's personal information.,[391], In addition to publicly apologizing, Facebook has said that it will be reviewing and auditing thousands of apps that display ""suspicious activities"" in an effort to ensure that this breach of privacy does not happen again.,[463], In a 2010 report regarding privacy, a research project stated that not a lot of information is available regarding the consequences of what people disclose online so often what is available are just reports made available through popular media.,[464], In 2017, a former Facebook executive went on the record to discuss how social media platforms have contributed to the unraveling of the ""fabric of society"".,[465],
,
,Content disputes and moderation,
,Main article: ,Facebook content management controversies,
,See also: ,Oversight Board,
,Facebook relies on its users to generate the content that bonds its users to the service. The company has come under criticism both for allowing objectionable content, including conspiracy theories and fringe discourse,,[466], and for prohibiting other content that it deems inappropriate.
,
,Misinformation and fake news,
,Facebook has been criticized as a vector for ,fake news,, and has been accused of bearing responsibility for the conspiracy theory that the United States created ,ISIS,,,[467], false anti-,Rohingya, posts being used by ,Myanmar,'s military to fuel ,genocide, and ,ethnic cleansing,,,[468],[469], enabling ,climate change denial,[470],[471],[472], and ,Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, conspiracy theorists,,[473], and anti-refugee attacks in Germany.,[474],[475],[476], The government of the ,Philippines, has also used Facebook as a tool to attack its critics.,[477],
,In 2017, Facebook partnered with fact checkers from the ,Poynter Institute,'s International Fact-Checking Network to identify and mark false content, though most ads from political candidates are exempt from this program.,[478],[479], As of 2018, Facebook had over 40 fact-checking partners across the world, including ,The Weekly Standard,.,[480], Critics of the program have accused Facebook of not doing enough to remove false information from its website.,[480],[481],
,Facebook has repeatedly amended its content policies. In July 2018, it stated that it would ""downrank"" articles that its ,fact-checkers, determined to be false, and remove misinformation that incited violence.,[482], Facebook stated that content that receives ""false"" ratings from its fact-checkers can be demonetized and suffer dramatically reduced distribution. Specific posts and videos that violate community standards can be removed on Facebook.,[483],
,In May 2019, Facebook banned a number of ""dangerous"" commentators from its platform, including ,Alex Jones,, ,Louis Farrakhan,, ,Milo Yiannopoulos,, ,Paul Joseph Watson,, ,Paul Nehlen,, ,David Duke,, and ,Laura Loomer,, for allegedly engaging in ""violence and hate"".,[484],[485],
,In May 2020, Facebook agreed to a preliminary settlement of $52 million ($61.2 million in 2023 dollars,[20],) to compensate U.S.-based Facebook content moderators for their psychological trauma suffered on the job.,[486],[487], Other legal actions around the world, including in Ireland, await settlement.,[488],
,In September 2020, the ,Government of Thailand, utilized the Computer Crime Act for the first time to take action against Facebook and ,Twitter, for ignoring requests to take down content and not complying with court orders.,[489],
,
,Threats and incitement,
,Professor ,Ilya Somin, reported that he had been the subject of death threats on Facebook in April 2018 from ,Cesar Sayoc,, who threatened to kill Somin and his family and ""feed the bodies to Florida alligators"". Somin's Facebook friends reported the comments to Facebook, which did nothing except dispatch automated messages.,[490], Sayoc was later arrested for the ,October 2018 United States mail bombing attempts, directed at Democratic politicians.
,
,Terrorism,
,Force v. Facebook, Inc,.,, 934 F.3d 53 (2nd Cir. 2019) was a case that alleged Facebook was profiting off recommendations for Hamas. In 2019, the ,US Second Circuit Appeals Court, held that ,Section 230, bars civil terrorism claims against ,social media companies, and internet service providers, the first federal appellate court to do so.
,
,Hate speech,
,In October 2020, ,Pakistani, Prime Minister ,Imran Khan, urged ,Mark Zuckerberg,, through a letter posted on government's ,Twitter, account, to ban ,Islamophobic, content on Facebook, warning that it encouraged ,extremism, and violence.,[491],
,In October 2020, the company announced that it would ban ,Holocaust denial,.,[492],
,In October 2022, ,Media Matters for America, published a report that Facebook and Instagram were still profiting off advertisements using the slur "",groomer,"" for ,LGBT, people.,[493], The article reported that Meta had previously confirmed that the use of this word for the LGBT community violates its hate speech policies.,[493], The story was subsequently picked up by other news outlets such as the ,New York Daily News,, ,PinkNews,, and ,LGBTQ Nation,.,[494],[495],[496],
,
,Violent Erotica,
,There are ads on Facebook and Instagram containing sexually explicit content, descriptions of graphic violence and content promoting acts of self harm. Many of the ads are for webnovel apps backed by tech giants ,Bytedance, and ,Tencent,.,[497],
,
,InfoWars,
,Facebook was criticized for allowing ,InfoWars, to publish falsehoods and conspiracy theories.,[483],[498],[499],[500],[501], Facebook defended its actions in regards to ,InfoWars,, saying ""we just don't think banning Pages for sharing conspiracy theories or false news is the right way to go."",[499], Facebook provided only six cases in which it fact-checked content on the ,InfoWars, page over the period September 2017 to July 2018.,[483], In 2018, ,InfoWars, falsely claimed that the survivors of the Parkland shooting were ""actors"". Facebook pledged to remove ,InfoWars, content making the claim, although ,InfoWars, videos pushing the false claims were left up, even though Facebook had been contacted about the videos.,[483], Facebook stated that the videos never explicitly called them actors.,[483], Facebook also allowed ,InfoWars, videos that shared the ,Pizzagate conspiracy theory, to survive, despite specific assertions that it would purge Pizzagate content.,[483], In late July 2018, Facebook suspended the personal profile of ,InfoWars, head Alex Jones for 30 days.,[502], In early August 2018, Facebook banned the four most active ,InfoWars,-related pages for ,hate speech,.,[503],
,
,Political manipulation,
,See also: ,State-sponsored Internet propaganda,
,Graffiti in Berlin of Facebook founder ,Mark Zuckerberg,. The caption is a reference to ,George Orwell,'s novel ,Nineteen Eighty-Four,.,
,As a dominant social-web service with massive outreach, Facebook have been used by identified or unidentified political operatives to affect public opinion. Some of these activities have been done in violation of the platform policies, creating ""coordinated inauthentic behavior"", support or attacks. These activities can be scripted or ,paid,. Various such abusive campaign have been revealed in recent years, best known being the ,Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections,. In 2021, former Facebook analyst within the ,Spam, and ,Fake Engagement, teams, ,Sophie Zhang,, reported more than 25 political subversion operations and criticized the general slow reaction time, oversightless, laissez-faire attitude by Facebook.,[504],[505],[506],
,
,Influence Operations and Coordinated Inauthentic Behavior,
,In 2018, Facebook stated that during 2018 they had identified ""coordinated inauthentic behavior"" in ""many Pages, Groups and accounts created to stir up political debate, including in the US, the Middle East, Russia and the UK."",[507],
,Campaigns operated by the British intelligence agency unit, called ,Joint Threat Research Intelligence Group,, have broadly fallen into two categories; cyber attacks and propaganda efforts. The propaganda efforts utilize ""mass messaging"" and the ""pushing [of] stories"" via social media sites like Facebook.,[508],[509], Israel's ,Jewish Internet Defense Force,, the ,Chinese Communist Party,'s ,50 Cent Party, and Turkey's ,AK Trolls, also focus their attention on social media platforms like Facebook.,[510],[511],[512],[513],
,In July 2018, Samantha Bradshaw, co-author of the report from the ,Oxford Internet Institute, (OII) at ,Oxford University,, said that ""The number of countries where formally organised ,social media manipulation, occurs has greatly increased, from 28 to 48 countries globally. The majority of growth comes from political parties who spread ,disinformation, and junk news around election periods."",[514],
,In October 2018, ,The Daily Telegraph, reported that Facebook ""banned hundreds of pages and accounts that it says were fraudulently flooding its site with partisan political content – although they came from the United States instead of being associated with ,Russia,."",[515],
,In December 2018, ,The Washington Post, reported that ""Facebook has suspended the account of Jonathon Morgan, the chief executive of a top social media research firm"" ,New Knowledge,, ""after reports that he and others engaged in an operation to spread disinformation"" on Facebook and Twitter during the ,2017 United States Senate special election in Alabama,.,[516],[517],
,In January 2019, Facebook said it has removed 783 Iran-linked accounts, pages and groups for engaging in what it called ""coordinated inauthentic behaviour"".,[518], In March 2019, Facebook sued four Chinese firms for selling ""fake accounts, likes and followers"" to amplify Chinese ,state media, outlets.,[519],
,In May 2019, ,Tel Aviv,-based private intelligence agency ,Archimedes Group, was banned from Facebook for ""coordinated inauthentic behavior"" after Facebook found fake users in countries in sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America and Southeast Asia.,[520], Facebook investigations revealed that Archimedes had spent some $1.1 million ($1.31 million in 2023 dollars,[20],) on fake ads, paid for in Brazilian reais, Israeli shekels and US dollars.,[521], Facebook gave examples of Archimedes Group political interference in Nigeria, Senegal, Togo, Angola, Niger and Tunisia.,[522], The Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab said in a report that ""The tactics employed by Archimedes Group, a private company, closely resemble the types of information warfare tactics often used by governments, and the Kremlin in particular."",[523],[524],
,On May 23, 2019, Facebook released its Community Standards Enforcement Report highlighting that it has identified several fake accounts through artificial intelligence and human monitoring. In a period of six months, October 2018 – March 2019, the social media website removed a total of 3.39 billion fake accounts. The number of fake accounts was reported to be more than 2.4 billion real people on the platform.,[525],
,In July 2019, Facebook advanced its measures to counter deceptive political propaganda and other abuse of its services. The company removed more than 1,800 accounts and pages that were being operated from Russia, Thailand, Ukraine and Honduras.,[526], After Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, it was announced that the internet regulatory committee would block access to Facebook.,[527],
,On October 30, 2019, Facebook deleted several accounts of the employees working at the Israeli ,NSO Group,, stating that the accounts were ""deleted for not following our terms"". The deletions came after WhatsApp sued the Israeli surveillance firm for targeting 1,400 devices with ,spyware,.,[528],
,
In 2020, Facebook helped found ,American Edge,, an anti-regulation ,lobbying firm, to fight anti-trust probes.,[529], The group runs ads that ""fail to mention what legislation concerns them, how those concerns could be fixed, or how the horrors they warn of could actually happen"", and do not clearly disclose that they are funded by Facebook.,[530],
,In 2020, the government of Thailand forced Facebook to take down a Facebook group called Royalist Marketplace with one million members following potentially illegal posts shared. The authorities have also threatened Facebook with legal action. In response, Facebook is planning to take legal action against the Thai government for suppression of freedom of expression and violation of human rights.,[531],
,In February 2021, Facebook removed the main page of the Myanmar military, after two protesters were shot and killed during the ,anti-coup protests,. Facebook said that the page breached its guidelines that prohibit the incitement of violence.,[532], On February 25, Facebook announced to ban all accounts of the Myanmar military, along with the "",Tatmadaw,-linked commercial entities"".

,Mueller contacted Facebook subsequently to the company's disclosure that it had sold more than $100,000 ($126,955 in 2023 dollars,[20],) worth of ads to a company (,Internet Research Agency,, owned by Russian billionaire and businessman ,Yevgeniy Prigozhin,) with links to the Russian intelligence community before the ,2016 United States presidential election,.,[542],[543], In September 2017, Facebook's chief security officer ,Alex Stamos, wrote the company ""found approximately $100,000 in ad spending from June 2015 to May 2017 – associated with roughly 3,000 ads – that was connected to about 470 inauthentic accounts and Pages in violation of our policies. Our analysis suggests these accounts and Pages were affiliated with one another and likely operated out of Russia."",[544], Clinton and Trump campaigns spent $81 million ($103 million in 2023 dollars,[20],) on Facebook ads.,[545],
,The company pledged full cooperation in ,Mueller's investigation,, and provided all information about the Russian advertisements.,[546], Members of the ,House, and ,Senate Intelligence Committees, have claimed that Facebook had withheld information that could illuminate the Russian propaganda campaign.,[547], Russian operatives have used Facebook polarize the American public discourses, organizing both ,Black Lives Matter, rallies,[548],[549], and anti-immigrant rallies on U.S. soil,,[550], as well as anti-Clinton rallies,[551], and rallies both for and against Donald Trump.,[552],[553], Facebook ads have also been used to exploit divisions over black political activism and Muslims by simultaneously sending contrary messages to different users based on their political and demographic characteristics in order to sow discord.,[554],[555],[556], Zuckerberg has stated that he regrets having dismissed concerns over Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.,[557],
,Russian-American billionaire ,Yuri Milner,, who befriended Zuckerberg,[558], between 2009 and 2011, had ,Kremlin, backing for his investments in Facebook and Twitter.,[63],
,
In January 2019, Facebook removed 289 pages and 75 coordinated accounts linked to the Russian state-owned news agency ,Sputnik, which had misrepresented themselves as independent news or general interest pages.,[559],[560], Facebook later identified and removed an additional 1,907 accounts linked to Russia found to be engaging in ""coordinated inauthentic behaviour"".,[561], In 2018, a UK ,Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, (DCMS) select committee report had criticised Facebook for its reluctance to investigate abuse of its platform by the Russian government, and for downplaying the extent of the problem, referring to the company as 'digital gangsters'.,[562],[563],[564],""Democracy is at risk from the malicious and relentless targeting of citizens with disinformation and personalised 'dark adverts' from unidentifiable sources, delivered through the major social media platforms we use every day,"" Damian Collins, DCMS Committee Chair,[564],In February 2019, ,Glenn Greenwald, wrote that a cybersecurity company New Knowledge, which is behind one of the ,Senate reports, on Russian social media election interference, ""was caught just six weeks ago engaging in a massive scam to create fictitious Russian troll accounts on Facebook and Twitter in order to claim that the Kremlin was working to defeat Democratic Senate nominee ,Doug Jones, in Alabama. ,The New York Times,, when exposing the scam, quoted a New Knowledge report that boasted of its fabrications..."",[565],[566],
,Anti-Rohingya propaganda,
,See also: ,Persecution of Muslims in Myanmar,
,In 2018, Facebook took down 536 Facebook pages, 17 Facebook groups, 175 Facebook accounts, and 16 Instagram accounts linked to the ,Myanmar, military. Collectively these were followed by over 10 million people.,[567], ,The New York Times, reported that:,[568],
,
,after months of reports about anti-Rohingya propaganda on Facebook, the company acknowledged that it had been too slow to act in Myanmar. By then, more than 700,000 Rohingya had fled the country in a year, in what United Nations officials called ""a textbook example of ethnic cleansing"".,
,Anti-Muslim propaganda and Hindu nationalism in India,
,A 2019 book titled ,The Real Face of Facebook in India,, co-authored by the journalists ,Paranjoy Guha Thakurta, and Cyril Sam, alleged that Facebook helped enable and benefited from the rise of ,Narendra Modi,'s ,Hindu nationalist, ,Bharatiya Janata Party, (BJP) in ,India,.,[569],
,Ankhi Das, Facebook's policy director for India and South and Central Asia, apologized publicly in August 2020 for sharing a Facebook post that called Muslims in India a ""degenerate community"". She said she shared the post ""to reflect my deep belief in celebrating feminism and civic participation"".,[570], She is reported to have prevented action by Facebook against anti-Muslim content,[571],[572], and supported the BJP in internal Facebook messages.,[573],[574],
,In 2020, Facebook executives overrode their employees' recommendations that the BJP politician ,T. Raja Singh, should be banned from the site for ,hate speech, and rhetoric that could lead to violence. Singh had said on Facebook that ,Rohingya Muslim immigrants, should be shot and had threatened to destroy ,mosques,. Current and former Facebook employees told ,The Wall Street Journal, that the decision was part of a pattern of favoritism by Facebook toward the BJP as it seeks more business in India.,[572], Facebook also took no action after BJP politicians made posts accusing Muslims of intentionally spreading ,COVID-19,, an employee said.,[575],
,On August 31, 2020, the ,Delhi Assembly, began investigating whether Facebook bore blame for the ,2020 religious riots, in the city, claiming it had found Facebook ""prima facie guilty of a role in the violence"".,[576],[577], On September 12, 2020, a Delhi Assembly committee said in a statement that it had asked Facebook India head Ajit Mohan to appear before it on September 15, leading to Facebook objecting and moving the ,Supreme Court of India, against the decision.,[578],[579], On September 15, Facebook skipped the Delhi Assembly panel hearing.,[580], On September 20, the Delhi Assembly panel issued a new notice asking Facebook to appear before it on September 23.,[581], On September 22, Facebook India vice-president and managing director Ajit Mohan moved the Supreme Court against the summons of the Delhi Assembly Committee.,[582], On September 23, the Supreme Court granted him relief and ordered a stay to the summons, with the Central government later backing the decision.,[583],[584],[585], A former Facebook employee told a Delhi Assembly panel on November 13 that the violence could have been 'easily averted' if the social media giant had acted in a 'proactive and prompt manner'.,[586], On December 3, the Delhi Assembly moved the Supreme Court for intervention in the case.,[587], On February 4, 2021, the Delhi Assembly panel issued a fresh notice to Facebook India to testify on the riots, avoiding specific notice to Mohan, by asking a senior, responsible officer from the company to appear before the panel.,[588], The Union government submitted in the Supreme Court that Facebook could not be made accountable before any state assembly and the committee formed was unconstitutional.,[589],[590], On February 24, Mohan challenged summons issued by the Delhi assembly for failing to appear before it as a witness in connection with the 2020 riots in the Supreme Court, saying that the 'right to silence' is a virtue in present 'noisy times' and the legislature had no authority to examine him in a law and order case. The Supreme Court reserved its judgment for the case.,[591], On July 8, the Supreme Court refused to quash the summons and asked Facebook asked to appear before the Delhi assembly panel.,[592],
,On September 23, 2023, it was reported that Facebook had delayed for about a year when in 2021, it removed a network of accounts ran by India's ,Chinar Corps, which spread disinformation that would put Kashmiri journalists in danger. The delay and the previously not publicized takedown action were due a fear that its local employees would be targeted by authorities, and that it would hurt business prospects in the country.,[593],
,
,Company governance,
,Early Facebook investor and former Zuckerberg mentor ,Roger McNamee, described Facebook as having ""the most centralized decision-making structure I have ever encountered in a large company."",[594], ,Nathan Schneider,, a professor of media studies at the University of Colorado Boulder argued for transforming Facebook into a ,platform cooperative, owned and governed by the users.,[595],
,Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes states that CEO Mark Zuckerberg has too much power, that the company is now a monopoly, and that, as a result, it should be split into multiple smaller companies. Hughes called for the breakup of Facebook in an ,op-ed, on ,The New York Times,. Hughes says he is concerned that Zuckerberg has surrounded himself with a team that does not challenge him and that as a result, it is the U.S. government's job to hold him accountable and curb his ""unchecked power"".,[596], Hughes also said that ""Mark's power is unprecedented and un-American."",[597], Several U.S. politicians agree with Hughes.,[598], EU Commissioner for Competition Margrethe Vestager has stated that splitting Facebook should only be done as ""a remedy of the very last resort"", and that splitting Facebook would not solve Facebook's underlying problems.,[599],
,
,Litigation,
,Further information: ,Lawsuits involving Meta Platforms,
,The company has been subject to repeated litigation.,[600],[601],[602],[603], Its most prominent case addressed allegations that Zuckerberg broke an ,oral contract, with ,Cameron Winklevoss,, ,Tyler Winklevoss,, and ,Divya Narendra, to build the ,then-named ""HarvardConnection"", social network in 2004.,[604],[605],[606],
,On March 6, 2018, ,BlackBerry, sued Facebook and its Instagram and WhatsApp subdivision for ripping off key features of its messaging app.,[607],
,In October 2018, a Texan woman sued Facebook, claiming she had been recruited into the sex trade at the age of 15 by a man who ""friended"" her on the social media network. Facebook responded that it works both internally and externally to ban sex traffickers.,[608],[609],
,In 2019, British solicitors representing a ,bullied Syrian schoolboy,, sued Facebook over ,false claims,. They claimed that Facebook protected prominent figures from scrutiny instead of removing content that violates its rules and that the special treatment was financially driven.,[610],[611],
,The Federal Trade Commission and a coalition of New York state and 47 other state and regional governments filed separate suits against Facebook on December 9, 2020, seeking antitrust action based on its acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsUp among other companies, calling these practices as anticompetitive. The suits also assert that in acquiring these products, they weakened their privacy measures for their users. The suits, besides other fines, seek to unwind the acquisitions from Facebook.,[612],[613],
,On January 6, 2022, France's data privacy regulatory body ,CNIL, fined Facebook a 60 million euros for not allowing its internet users an easy refusal of ,cookies, along with ,Google,.,[614],
,On December 22, 2022, the Quebec Court of Appeal approved a class-action lawsuit on behalf of Facebook users who claim they were discriminated against because the platform allows advertisers to target both job and housing advertisements based on various factors, including age, gender, and even race.,[615], The lawsuit centres on the platform's practice of ""micro targeting ads"", claiming ads are ensured to appear only in the feeds of people who belong to certain targeted groups. Women, for example, would not see ads targeting men, while older generation men would not see an ad aimed at people between 18 and 45.,[615],
,The class action could include thousands of Quebec residents who have been using the platform as early as April 2016, who were seeking jobs or housing during that period.,[615], Facebook has 60 days after the court's December 22 ruling to decide to appeal the case to the Supreme Court of Canada. If it does not appeal, the case returns to the Quebec Superior Court.,[615],
,
,Minors exposed to sexual content on VR apps,
,In February 2022, a ,BBC News, researcher posing as a 13-year-old girl witnessed grooming, sexual material, racist insults and a rape threat on the ,VRChat, app. The ,National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, head of online child safety policy Andy Burrows added the investigation had found ""a toxic combination of risks"". The BBC researcher downloaded VRChat from an app store on Facebook's ,Meta Quest, headset, with no age verification checks – the only requirement being a Facebook account. The BBC News researcher created a fake profile to set up her account – and her real identity was not checked.,[616],[617], While Oculus has a form where users can report abuse, the ,Center for Countering Digital Hate, claims Meta rarely takes them seriously; although reporting 100 policy violations on Oculus, they did not receive a response. Imran Ahmed, the charity's chief executive, branded it ""a cesspit of hate, pornography and child grooming"".,[618],[619],
,
,Impact,
,Facebook on the ,ad:tech, 2010,
,Scope,
,A commentator in ,The Washington Post, noted that Facebook constitutes a ""massive depository of information that documents both our reactions to events and our evolving customs with a scope and immediacy of which earlier historians could only dream"".,[620], Especially for anthropologists, social researchers, and social historians—and subject to proper preservation and curation—the website ""will preserve images of our lives that are vastly crisper and more nuanced than any ancestry record in existence"".,[620],
,
,Economy,
,Economists have noted that Facebook offers many non-rivalrous services that benefit as many users as are interested without forcing users to compete with each other. By contrast, most goods are available to a limited number of users. E.g., if one user buys a phone, no other user can buy that phone. Three areas add the most economic impact: platform competition, the market place and user behavior data.,[621],
,Facebook began to reduce its carbon impact after Greenpeace attacked it for its long-term reliance on coal and resulting carbon footprint.,[622], In 2021 Facebook announced that their global operations are supported by 100 percent renewable energy and they have reached net zero emissions, a goal set in 2018.,[623],[624],
,Facebook provides a development platform for many ,social gaming,, communication, feedback, review, and other applications related to online activities. This platform spawned many businesses and added thousands of jobs to the global economy. ,Zynga Inc.,, a leader in social gaming, is an example of such a business. An ,econometric, analysis found that Facebook's app development platform added more than 182,000 jobs in the U.S. economy in 2011. The total economic value of the added employment was about $12 billion ($16.3 billion in 2023 dollars,[20],).,[625],

,Facebook was one of the first large-scale ,social networks,. In ,The Facebook Effect,, David Kirkpatrick stated that Facebook's structure makes it difficult to replace, because of its "",network effects,"".,[,neutrality, is ,disputed,], As of 2016, it is estimated that 44 percent of the US population gets news through Facebook.,[626], A study published at ,Frontiers Media, in 2023 found that there was more polarization of the user-base on Facebook than even far-right social networks like Gab.,[627],
,
,Mental and emotional health,
,See also: ,Social media and suicide,
,Studies have associated social networks with positive,[628], and negative impacts,[629],[630],[631],[632],[633], on emotional health.
,Studies have associated Facebook with feelings of ,envy,, often triggered by vacation and holiday photos. Other triggers include posts by friends about family happiness and images of physical beauty—such feelings leave people dissatisfied with their own lives. A joint study by two German universities discovered that one out of three people were more dissatisfied with their lives after visiting Facebook,,[634],[635], and another study by ,Utah Valley University, found that college students felt worse about themselves following an increase in time on Facebook.,[635],[636],[637], Professor Larry D. Rosen stated that teenagers on Facebook exhibit more narcissistic tendencies, while young adults show signs of antisocial behavior, ,mania, and aggressiveness.
,Positive effects include signs of ""virtual empathy"" with online friends and helping introverted persons learn social skills.,[638], A 2020 experimental study in the ,American Economic Review, found that deactivating Facebook led to increased subjective well-being.,[639], In a blog post in December 2017, the company highlighted research that has shown ""passively consuming"" the ,News Feed,, as in reading but not interacting, left users with negative feelings, whereas interacting with messages pointed to improvements in well-being.,[640],

,A man during the 2011 Egyptian protests carrying a card saying ""Facebook,#jan25, The Egyptian Social Network"",
,During the ,Arab Spring, many journalists claimed that Facebook played a major role in the ,2011 Egyptian revolution,.,[643],[644], On January 14, the Facebook page of ""We are all Khaled Said"" was started by Wael Ghoniem to invite the Egyptian people to ""peaceful demonstrations"" on January 25. According to ,Mashable,,,[,unreliable source?,], in Tunisia and Egypt, Facebook became the primary tool for connecting protesters and led the Egyptian government to ban Facebook, Twitter and other websites on January 26,[645], then ban all mobile and Internet connections for all of Egypt on January 28. After 18 days, the uprising forced President ,Hosni Mubarak, to resign.
,In ,a Bahraini uprising, that started on February 14, 2011, Facebook was utilized by the Bahraini regime and regime loyalists to identify, capture and prosecute citizens involved in the protests. A 20-year-old woman named ,Ayat Al Qurmezi, was identified as a protester using Facebook and imprisoned.,[646],
,In 2011, Facebook filed paperwork with the ,Federal Election Commission, to form a ,political action committee, under the name ,FB PAC,.,[647], In an email to ,The Hill,, a spokesman for Facebook said ""Facebook ,Political Action Committee, will give our employees a way to make their voice heard in the political process by supporting candidates who share our goals of promoting the value of innovation to our economy while giving people the power to share and make the world more open and connected."",[648],
,During the Syrian civil war, the ,YPG,, a libertarian army for ,Rojava, recruited westerners through Facebook in its fight against ,ISIL,.,[649], Dozens joined its ranks. The Facebook page's name ""The Lions of Rojava"" comes from a Kurdish saying which translates as ""A lion is a lion, whether it's a female or a male"", reflecting the organization's feminist ideology.,[650],
,In recent years, Facebook's ,News Feed, algorithms have been identified as a cause of political polarization, for which it has been criticized.,[651],[652], It has likewise been accused of amplifying the reach of ',fake news,' and extreme viewpoints, as when it may have enabled conditions which led to the ,2015 Rohingya refugee crisis,.,[653],[654],
,Facebook first played a role in the American political process in January 2008, shortly before the ,New Hampshire primary,. Facebook teamed up with ,ABC, and ,Saint Anselm College, to allow users to give live feedback about the ""back to back"" January 5 Republican and Democratic debates.,[655],[656],[657], Facebook users took part in debate groups on specific topics, voter registration and message questions.,[658],
,Over a million people installed the Facebook application ""US Politics on Facebook"" in order to take part which measured responses to specific comments made by the debating candidates.,[659], A poll by ,CBS News,, ,UWIRE, and ,The Chronicle of Higher Education, claimed to illustrate how the ""Facebook effect"" had affected youthful voters, increasing voting rates, support of political candidates, and general involvement.,[660],
,The new social media, such as Facebook and Twitter, connected hundreds of millions of people. By 2008, politicians and interest groups were experimenting with systematic use of social media to spread their message.,[661],[662], By the 2016 election, political advertising to specific groups had become normalized. Facebook offered the most sophisticated targeting and analytics platform.,[663], ,ProPublica, noted that their system enabled advertisers to direct their pitches to almost 2,300 people who expressed interest in the topics of ""Jew hater"", ""How to burn Jews"", or, ""History of 'why Jews ruin the world"".,[664],
,Facebook has used several initiatives to encourage its users to register to vote and vote. An experiment in 2012 involved showing Facebook users pictures of their friends who reported that they had voted; users who were shown the pictures were about 2% more likely to report that they had also voted compared to the ,control group,, which was not encouraged to vote.,[665], In 2020, Facebook announced the goal of helping four million voters register in the US, saying that it had registered 2.5 million by September.,[666],
,The ,Cambridge Analytica data scandal, offered another example of the perceived attempt to influence elections.,[667],[668], ,The Guardian, claimed that Facebook knew about the security breach for two years, but did nothing to stop it until it became public.,[669],
,Facebook banned political ads to prevent the manipulation of voters in the US's November's election. Industry experts suggested,[,clarification needed,], that there are several other ways for misinformation to reach voters on social media platforms and blocking political ads will not serve as a proven solution to the problem.,[670],
,In March 2024, former US President ,Donald Trump, said that getting rid of TikTok would allow Facebook, which he called the ""enemy of the people"", to double its business. He spoke after ,President Biden, said he was ready to sign legislation that would require ,TikTok, owner ,ByteDance, to sell the video platform or face a ban in the US.,[671],
,
,India,
,Ahead of the 2019 general elections in India, Facebook has removed 103 pages, groups and accounts on Facebook and Instagram platforms originating from Pakistan. Facebook said its investigation found a Pakistani military link, along with a mix of real accounts of ISPR employees, and a network of fake accounts created by them that have been operating military fan pages, general interest pages but were posting content about Indian politics while trying to conceal their identity.,[672], Owing to the same reasons, Facebook also removed 687 pages and accounts of Congress because of coordinated inauthentic behavior on the platform.,[673],

,Marie Catherine Neal, (December 7, 1889 – June 6, 1965) was an American ,botanist, and author known for her contributions to the study of ,Hawaiian, flora and her efforts to popularize botanical knowledge.,[1],
,
,
,Biography,[,edit,],
,Early life and education,[,edit,],
,Marie Catherine Neal was born on December 7, 1889, in ,Southington, Connecticut,, to Linus B. Neal, a banker, and Eva W. Chedney.,[2], Her interest in nature was sparked during childhood hunting and fishing excursions with her father, leading to a lifelong passion for botany.,[1],
,Neal pursued her education at ,Smith College,, graduating in 1912 with a ,B.A. degree,. Her studies included a course in botany. During her college years, she gained administrative experience working as a secretary for various organizations.,[1],[2], She received an MS degree from ,Yale University, in 1925.,[3],[4],
,
,Career,[,edit,],
,Following her graduation, Neal began her career in botany as a secretary in the geology department at Yale under ,Herbert E. Gregory,. In 1920, she moved to ,Honolulu, Hawaii,, to continue her work for Gregory at the ,Bishop Museum,. Initially placed in the ,conchology, department, Neal's botanical interests led her to focus on Hawaiian flora. During her tenure at the Bishop Museum from 1920 to 1930, Neal made notable contributions to the study of Hawaiian plants. She collaborated on research projects, including cataloging terrestrial ,mollusks, and coauthoring a monograph on ,land snails,.,[1],
,Neal's expertise in botany extended beyond academia. She contributed articles to the ,Paradise of the Pacific, magazine, popularizing her knowledge of Hawaii's cultivated plants. In 1928, Neal coauthored her first major book, ""In Honolulu Gardens,"" which provided scientific descriptions and illustrations of Hawaiian plants. The book received acclaim for its blend of botanical information with Hawaiian legends and folklore.,[1],
,
,Contributions to botany,[,edit,],
,In 1930, Neal was appointed botanist at the Bishop Museum, where she expanded the ,herbarium, collections and earned international recognition for her scholarship. She assisted scholars and the public in identifying Hawaiian plants and contributed to the museum's educational initiatives. Neal's botanical research extended to the outer islands of Hawaii, where she conducted extensive fieldwork, discovering new plant species and conducting research for her publications.,[1],
,
,Later life and legacy,[,edit,],
,Marie Catherine Neal's significant work, ,In Gardens of Hawaii,, published in 1948 and revised in 1965, described over 2,000 botanic species with detailed scientific information and illustrations. Neal's contributions to botany were recognized, and she received honors for her scientific achievements. She died on June 6, 1965.,[1],[2],[5],

,The ,bicycle, had a significant impact on the lives of women in a variety of areas.,[1],[2],[3], The greatest impact the bicycle had on the societal role of women occurred in the 1890s during the ,bicycle craze, that swept American and European society.,[4], During this time, the primary achievement the bicycle gained for the women's movement was that it gave women a greater amount of social mobility.,[3],[5], The ,feminist, ,Annie Londonderry, accomplished her around-the-globe bicycle trip as the first woman in this time.,[6],[7],[8], Due to the price and the various payment plans offered by American bicycle companies, the bicycle was affordable to the majority of people.,[3], However, the bicycle impacted upper and middle class white women the most.,[3], This transformed their role in society from remaining in the private or domestic sphere as caregivers, wives, and mothers to one of greater public appearance and involvement in the community.,[3],[9], In the 21st century bicycling remains a contentious issue addressed by feminists in countries such as Saudi Arabia and Iran.

,Between the 1860s and the mid-1880s, the standard bicycle was the ,ordinary, or high wheeler, which was both hard to master and dangerous to use. While the ordinary was exclusively used by men, women were allowed to use bicycles such as the two-seater ,sociable,, the ,tandem bicycle,, and the ,tricycle,. Beginning in the late 1860s companionate riding became a popular social activity for men and women. These vehicles allowed men and women to develop new methods of coed socialization. However, up until the mid 1880s, women were primarily dependent upon men in order to participate in ,cycling,. The presence of a man in control of the sociable assumed that the man could keep the woman safe from the dangers of riding a ,bike, alone, thereby assuming the authority of man. So while companionate riding was revolutionary in the development in sociability between men and women, it kept women in an inferior position to men by assuming that the man had the power over the ,bicycle, in that situation.,[3],[10],

,According to Alon Raab, a professor of Religious Studies at ,UC Davis,, opposition to cycling in the ,Ottoman Empire, was quick from conservatives and religious fundamentalists, who frequently criticized bicycles as the Devil's Chariot.,[11], Orthodox scholars claimed that cycling would harm reproductive organs, embolden sexual permissiveness and lead to the destruction of the family.,[11], Raab additionally notes that their unmentioned objective was to keep women in their homes and to restrict nonsupervised contact between men and women.,[11], Raab reports that many Muslim religious authorities castigated women's cycling as ,bid’ah, (any technical innovation deemed heretical).,[11], He points out that women's cycling was criticized in the media and by law, and in some places, female cyclists faced physical assaults. He reports that despite opposition, in the early 20th century, women in the Ottoman Empire nevertheless went on to adopt cycling for varied purposes with a new sense of freedom.,[12], Feminist activists' efforts to expand the political rights of women, like those of ,Fatma Aliye Topuz,, were helped along by the bicycle.,[12],[11],

,Between 1885 and 1895, inventors and engineers vastly improved the previous generation of bicycle to what was then called ,safety bicycle,.,[3], With these developments, a type of safety bicycle was designed for women in particular with a ,drop frame, in order to accommodate women's clothes. However, the long skirts and the tight-fitted bodices of this time period made cycling an even greater challenge. Therefore, several modified outfits were offered to women that would accommodate the bicycle. Some modifications included divided skirts, skirts that shortened with drawstrings, skirts that converted to ,bloomers,, skirt-securing devices that kept the fabric close to the ankle, and a bicycle corset consisting of a sturdy, straight under-bodice with extra back support and a looser fit. Of all the bicycle costumes, the bloomer costume was and still is the most widely known from this time period. This consisted of full trousers, gathered at the ankle, worn with a calf-length skirt with a fashionable jacket on top.,[10],
,These clothes were met with mixed approval. ,Elizabeth Cady Stanton, in her notes on whether or not women should ride a bicycle stated, ""To sum up, I would say, let women ride .... If some prefer the [bulk] skirts flying in the wind exhausted in the wheels let them run the risk of their folly; If others prefer bloomers let them enjoy their choice- if others prefer ,knickerbockers,, leave them in peace."",[2], In instructive books written for women on how to ride a bicycle, many authors insist that wearing bicycle costumes made it easier to ride.,[14], In both cases, it seems that the decision to wear these athletic costumes was a personal choice for women. By making this choice, women to a small degree were able to take control of their life. At the same time, it was presented as a rational choice as wearing the full fashion of the time could make cycling more difficult for the rider. Because of this the decision to wear these clothes was closely related to the decision to ride a bicycle.,[10],
,For the most part, men were the main opponents of women wearing bicycle clothing and in particular, ,bloomers,. This can be seen in a lot of songs from this time period. For example, a rendition of "",Mary Had a Little Lamb,"" from 1895 written by ,Stanislaus Stange, had a verse that went:
,
,.mw-parser-output .templatequote{overflow:hidden;margin:1em 0;padding:0 32px}.mw-parser-output .templatequote .templatequotecite{line-height:1.5em;text-align:left;padding-left:1.6em;margin-top:0},
,""Dear Mary,"" said the little lamb,,
""It gives me quite a fright,
To see the girls on bicycles,,
They're such a novel sight.,
Why is it they all Bloomers wear?,
The sight my blood congeals."",
Then Mary touched her forehead thus,,
And gently murmured: ""Wheels."",[15],
,
,
,In this case, the very idea of the bicycle suit and women's potential to wear it disturbed some men. They saw these suits and in particular bloomers as ugly or shameful. In particular, they saw these bicycle costumes as a physical representation of women stealing men's characteristics, thereby blurring the lines between femininity and masculinity and what is socially acceptable for each group. What this fear reveals is a realistic notion that women were taking on a greater role of independence of which had previously been characterized as masculine.,[3],[10],
,To address modesty concerns, a proposed Iranian version of a women's bicycle would have a ""boxy contraption that hides a woman's lower body"".,[16],
,
,Health,[,edit,],
,Lectures of the ,female gynaecologist, Volkova about influence of the bicycle on health of the woman (1897).,[17],
,During the late nineteenth century, doctors began encouraging everyone in public to exercise more often and ,cycling, became a popular activity in which to do so. However, doctors were worried about the effects of excessive cycling, particularly how it affected women. An 1895 article in ,The Literary Digest, reviewed literature from the time period, which discussed the bicycle face, and noted that The Springfield Republican warned against excessive cycling by ""women, girls, and middle-aged men."",[18], The bicycle face was described as a face usually flushed, but sometimes pale, often with lips more or less drawn, and the beginning of dark shadows under the eyes, and always an expression of weariness.,[18],
These articles pushed forth the belief that excessive cycling made women vulnerable to many diseases such as developing an ,exophthalmic goiter,, appendicitis, and internal inflammation.,[19], His article was subsequently discussed and analyzed in ,The Advertiser,.,[20], 
,Another concern doctors had about women riding the bicycle was over their sexual health. Doctors believed that the bicycle saddle taught masturbation to women and girls. Riding astride anything was seen as too masculine for any proper woman. These physicians wrote in detail in medical journals about how the bicycle could be used for masturbation:
,
,The saddle can be tilted in every bicycle as desired… In this way a girl… could, by carrying the front peak or pommel high, or by relaxing the stretched leather in order to let it form a deep, hammock-like concavity which would fit itself snugly over the entire vulva and reach up in front, bring about constant friction over the clitoris and labia. This pressure would be much increased by stooping forward and the warmth generated from vigorous exercise might further increase feeling.,[21],
,These doctors were not concerned with sexual health, but rather sexual morality. Young women were supposed to be chaste and pure. They were trained from a young age to guard their sexual innocence. The fact that the bicycle had potential to awaken sexual feelings in women not only threatened their sexual purity, but also threatened to destroy gender definitions of sexual morality. Therefore, the bicycle is seen again as blurring the definition of masculine and feminine characteristics.,[5],
,At the same time as male doctors were stating the capabilities of women and the weakness of their bodies in relation to the bicycle, bicycle enthusiasts disagreed with this medical assessment, and asserted that the physical activity was good to improve one's health and vitality.,[22], Women began to express what their bodies were capable of through ,magazine, articles. Women like Mary Bisland, Mary Sargent Hopkins, and Emma Moffett Tyng contested medical commonplaces and promoted new ones in their place. These women stated that cycling brought long-inactive muscles back to life, and helped riders feel better emotionally and encouraged women to use their own experiences with the bicycle to determine their physical limits. These women brought to public attention the positive aspects that help women riders. The ,bicycle, not only makes them literally stronger, but also makes them more confident in their own abilities. This in turn not only gives women a greater agency over their body, but also mentally strengthens them to take on their previous domestic role and explore new roles in the public sphere.,[23],
,The 1977 book ,Women in the Arab World, by the Egyptian feminist ,Nawal El Saadawi,, reports that Arab culture used to place undue importance on female  virginity. For example, a girl whose ,hymen, was damaged as a result of sports activities like cycling or horse riding had to face negative consequences in her family life and social stature.,[24],
,
,Solo female bicycle travelers,[,edit,],
,Woman in bicycle clothes and buttoned on skirt that also can be used as raincoat,
,Annie Londonderry, in 1896,
,Bicycle touring, is a type of ,adventure travel,, whereby a traveler uses a bicycle as the major means of transportation. A bicycle traveler might also use ,panniers, to transport her equipment. Such travel can be almost completely self-sustained and autonomous, once the equipment includes a tent, cooking tools, a medical pack, repair tools, cooking fuel, water containers and multiple days of food supplies. ,Women Cycle the World, is one of the many websites, which offer a list solo female long-distance cyclists and their blog.,[25], For instance, Rebecca Lowe crossed Iran, ,Dervla Murphy, crossed Afghanistan and Helen Lloyd crossed Africa.,[26],[27],
The book ,WOW — Women on Wheels, by solo female cycle traveler ,Loretta Henderson, reported a global number of 245 solo female cycle travelers.,[28], ,Annie Londonderry, is the first woman to have cycled the world as early as in 1894–95.,[8],
,Issues of safety and security for solo female long-distance cyclists are often raised by those meeting them for the first time.,[29],[30], Such sources often come off with encouraging answers and useful advice, such as researching road and destination, staying visible on the road, and planning lodging options such as ,camping,, ,bed and breakfast, and ,Warm Showers, ahead.,[31],[32],[33], ,Around the world cycling record, breaking ,Jenny Graham, was even advised to carry a firearm in ,Yukon, due to the 'bear season'.,[34], She got along with ,""three bells, a whistle, flash lights on the front and back of her bike and bear spray"", instead of a firearm.

,Gender gap,[,edit,],
,According to Jennifer Bonham and Kat Jungnicke  lot of the gender and cycling literature studies  reasons behind uneven uptake among diverse populations.,[12], Jennifer Bonham and Kat Jungnicke state that women may be behind in numbers among cyclists of low-cycling countries like Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, the UK and the US, but they have very similar numbers to men in high-cycling countries like the Netherlands and Denmark. That makes it incorrect to infer that women have any natural aversion to ride bikes.,[12],
,
,Bicycle rallies in 21st-century Pakistan,[,edit,],
,Being influenced by sexualized patriarchal culture, various levels of seclusion of women from public participation are practiced in Pakistan. Taboos may require women to sit in a particular manner, not ride a bicycle, and limit public contact. Since the first ,Aurat March, (an ,International Women's Day, march) in 2018, women's bicycle rallies in ,Karachi, were started. On ,International Women's Day, 2021, around 150 women of various backgrounds participated in the bicycle ride.,[35],[36],
,
,Publications,[,edit,],
,During the 1890s, many women and some men wrote self-help books in order to help women learn how to ride a ,bicycle,. Within these books, they gave tips and personal reflections about the impact of the bicycle on their lives. ,Frances Elizabeth Willard,, the national president of the ,Woman's Christian Temperance Union, (WCTU) wrote a book called ,A Wheel Within A Wheel,, in which she discusses the exhilaration and health benefits she received by learning to ride as well as how she used cycling as a compelling social activity to stop men and women from drinking.,[1],
,Elizabeth Cady Stanton, wrote that the bicycle was a tool which motivated women to gain strength and take on increased roles in society.,[37], ,Susan B. Anthony, stated in 1896: ""Let me tell you what I think of bicycling. I think it has done more to emancipate women than anything else in the world. I stand and rejoice every time I see a woman ride by on a wheel."",[37],
,Beatrice Grimshaw,, who went on to a life of travel and adventure, describes a girlhood of Victorian propriety, in which she was: ""the Revolting Daughter–as they called them then. I bought a bicycle, with difficulty. I rode it unchaperoned, mile and miles beyond the limits possible to the soberly trotting horses. The world opened before me. And as soon as my twenty-first birthday dawned, I went away from home, to see what the world might to give to daughters who revolted."",[38],
,Within the experiences of all these women, they indicate a similar experience of the world opening up to them. In the literal sense, they could leave the private sphere for the public sphere and in doing so escape the ,cult of domesticity, in which societal norms kept them imprisoned. At the same time, they see the potential for new opportunities in which women can take an active role within their community. Through these readings, the women begin to see their potential as active and independent members of society.,[39],[14],[1],
,
,Contemporary legal status,[,edit,],
,In Saudi Arabia, women are banned from cycling for transportation purposes. Cycling may be used only for recreation and is subject to various religious restrictions.,[40],
,In Iran, cycling in public spaces has been banned under a ,fatwa, since 2016 despite widespread resistance amongst Iranian women.,[41], Advocates of women cyclists have been attacked by ,vigilantes,.,[42],

As in other lands, opposition to cycling was quick to appear, mostly from conservative elements and religious fundamentalists who often labeled it the Devil's Chariot. Several Muslim religious authorities designated it as bid'ah (any technological innovation deemed heretical) with bans on cycling in Yemen and Saudi Arabia. In other places most of the attacks – expressed in the press but also in laws and physical assaults on riders – were directed at women cyclists. Claims that cycling harms reproductive organs, encourages sexual permissiveness and the destruction of the family were common. Unstated was the desire to confine women to their homes and to prevent unsupervised meetings between men and women. Still, women cyclists persisted.  . ...,

Since the 1990s, this debate has often started with the observation that in low-cycling countries, including Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, the UK and the USA, men are much more likely to cycle than women. By contrast, women in high-cycling countries like The Netherlands and Denmark are as, if not more, likely to cycle than men (e.g. Aldred et al. 2017). These national differences, along with historical accounts of women cycling (e.g. Jungnickel 2018), counter arguments that women have a 'natural' aversion to riding a bike (Garrard, Handy & Dill 2012). Much of the gender and cycling literature is concerned with examining how and why cycling is or isn't available to diverse populations and the barriers in place that impede its uptake.  ..,

,A ,nonprofit organization, (,NPO,), also known as a ,nonbusiness entity,[1], or ,nonprofit institution,,,[2], and often referred to simply as a ,nonprofit, (not followed by a noun), is a legal entity organized and operated for a collective, public or social benefit, as opposed to an entity that operates as a business aiming to generate a ,profit, for its owners. A nonprofit is subject to the non-distribution constraint: any revenues that exceed expenses must be committed to the organization's purpose, not taken by private parties. An array of organizations are nonprofit, including some political organizations, schools, business associations, churches, social clubs, and consumer cooperatives. Nonprofit entities may seek approval from governments to be ,tax-exempt,, and some may also qualify to receive ,tax-deductible, contributions, but an entity may incorporate as a nonprofit entity without having tax-exempt status.
,Key aspects of nonprofits are accountability, trustworthiness, honesty, and openness to every person who has invested time, money, and faith into the organization. Nonprofit organizations are accountable to the donors, founders, volunteers, program recipients, and the public community. Theoretically, for a nonprofit that seeks to finance its operations through donations, public confidence is a factor in the amount of money that a nonprofit organization is able to raise.  Supposedly, the more a nonprofit focus on their mission, the more public confidence they will gain. This will result in more money for the organization.,[1], The activities a nonprofit is partaking in can help build the public's confidence in nonprofits, as well as how ethical the standards and practices are.
,There is an important distinction in the US between ,non-profit, and ,not-for-profit organizations, (NFPOs);  while an NFPO does not profit its owners, and money goes into running the organization, it is not required to operate for the public good. An example is a sports club, whose purpose is its members' enjoyment.,[3], The names used and precise regulations vary from one ,jurisdiction, to another.
,

,United States,[,edit,],
,According to the ,National Center for Charitable Statistics, (NCCS), there are more than 1.5 million nonprofit organizations registered in the ,United States,, including ,public charities,, ,private foundations,, and other nonprofit organizations. Private charitable contributions increased for the fourth consecutive year in 2017 (since 2014), at an estimated $410.02 billion. Out of these contributions, religious organizations received 30.9%, education organizations received 14.3%, and human services organizations received 12.1%.,[4], Between September 2010 and September 2014, approximately 25.3% of Americans over the age of 16 volunteered for a nonprofit.,[5],
,In the United States, both nonprofits are tax-exempt. There are various types of nonprofit exemptions, such as ,501(c)(3) organizations, that are a religious, charitable, or educational-based organization that does not influence state and federal legislation, and ,501(c)(7), organizations that are for pleasure, recreation, or another nonprofit purpose.,[,citation needed,],
,There is an important distinction in the US between ,non-profit, and ,not-for-profit organizations, (NFPOs);  while an NFPO does not profit its owners, and money goes into running the organization, it is not required to operate for the public good. An example is a club, whose purpose is its members' enjoyment.,[3], Examples of NFPOs are credit unions, sports clubs, and advocacy groups. Nonprofit organizations provide services to the community; for example aid and development programs, medical research, education, and health services. It is possible for a nonprofit to be both member-serving and community-serving.,[,citation needed,],
,
,Fundraising,[,edit,],
,Nonprofit organizations are not driven by generating profit, but they must bring in enough income to pursue their social goals. Nonprofits are able to raise money in different ways. This includes income from donations from individual donors or foundations; sponsorship from corporations; government funding; programs, services or merchandise sales, and investments.,[6], Each NPO is unique in which source of income works best for them. With an increase in NPOs since 2010, organizations have adopted competitive advantages to create revenue for themselves to remain financially stable. Donations from private individuals or organizations can change each year and government grants have diminished. With changes in funding from year to year, many nonprofit organizations have been moving toward increasing the diversity of their funding sources. For example, many nonprofits that have relied on government grants have started fundraising efforts to appeal to individual donors.,[7],
,
,Management,[,edit,],
,Most nonprofits have staff that work for the company, possibly using volunteers to perform the nonprofit's services under the direction of the paid staff. Nonprofits must be careful to balance the salaries paid to staff against the money paid to provide services to the nonprofit's beneficiaries. Organizations whose salary expenses are too high relative to their program expenses may face regulatory scrutiny.,[8],
,A second misconception is that nonprofit organizations may not make a profit. Although the goal of nonprofits is not specifically to maximize profits, they still have to operate as a fiscally responsible business. They must manage their income (both grants and donations and income from services) and expenses so as to remain a fiscally viable entity. Nonprofits have the responsibility of focusing on being professional, financially responsible, replacing self-interest and ,profit motive, with mission motive.,[9],
,Though nonprofits are managed differently from for-profit businesses, they have felt pressure to be more businesslike. To combat private and public business growth in the public service industry, nonprofits have modeled their business management and mission, shifting their reason of existing to establish sustainability and growth.,[10],
,Setting effective missions is a key for the successful management of nonprofit organizations.,[11], There are three important conditions for effective mission: opportunity, competence, and commitment.,[11],
,One way of managing the sustainability of nonprofit organizations is to establish strong relations with donor groups.,[11], This requires a donor marketing strategy, something many nonprofits lack.,[11],
,
,Functions,[,edit,],
,Nonprofit organizations provide public goods that are undersupplied by government.,[12], NPOs have a wide diversity of structures and purposes. For legal classification, there are, nevertheless, some elements of importance:
,
,Management provisions,
,Accountability and auditing provisions,
,Provisory for the amendment of the statutes or articles of incorporation,
,Provisions for the dissolution of the entity,
,Tax statuses of corporate and private donors,
,Tax status of the founders.,
,Some of the above must be (in most jurisdictions in the US at least) expressed in the organization's charter of establishment or constitution. Others may be provided by the supervising authority at each particular jurisdiction.
,While affiliations will not affect a legal status, they may be taken into consideration by legal proceedings as an indication of purpose. Most countries have laws that regulate the establishment and management of NPOs and that require compliance with ,corporate governance, regimes. Most larger organizations are required to publish their financial reports detailing their income and expenditure publicly.
,In many aspects, they are similar to corporate ,business entities, though there are often significant differences. Both not-for-profit,[,clarification needed,], and ,for-profit, corporate entities must have board members, steering-committee members, or trustees who owe the organization a ,fiduciary duty, of loyalty and trust. A notable exception to this involves ,churches,, which are often not required to disclose finances to anyone, including church members.,[13],
,
,Formation and structure,[,edit,],
,In the United States, nonprofit organizations are formed by filing bylaws or ,articles of incorporation, or both in the state in which they expect to operate. The act of incorporation creates a legal entity enabling the organization to be treated as a distinct body (corporation) by law and to enter into business dealings, form contracts, and own property as individuals or for-profit corporations can.
,Nonprofits can have members, but many do not. The nonprofit may also be a ,trust, or ,association, of members. The organization may be controlled by its members who elect the ,board of directors,, ,board of governors, or board of ,trustees,. A nonprofit may have a delegate structure to allow for the representation of groups or corporations as members. Alternatively, it may be a non-membership organization and the board of directors may elect its own successors.
,The two major types of nonprofit organization are membership and board-only. A membership organization elects the board and has regular meetings and the power to amend the bylaws. A board-only organization typically has a self-selected board and a membership whose powers are limited to those delegated to it by the board. A board-only organization's bylaws may even state that the organization does not have any membership, although the organization's literature may refer to its donors or service recipients as 'members'; examples of such organizations are ,FairVote,[14],[15], and the ,National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws,.,[16], The ,Model Nonprofit Corporation Act, imposes many complexities and requirements on membership decision-making.,[17], Accordingly, many organizations, such as the ,Wikimedia Foundation,,,[18], have formed board-only structures. The ,National Association of Parliamentarians, has generated concerns about the implications of this trend for the future of openness, accountability, and understanding of public concerns in nonprofit organizations. Specifically, they note that nonprofit organizations, unlike business corporations, are not subject to ,market discipline, for products and shareholder discipline of their capital; therefore, without membership control of major decisions such as the election of the board, there are few inherent safeguards against abuse.,[19],[20], A rebuttal to this might be that as nonprofit organizations grow and seek larger donations, the degree of scrutiny increases, including expectations of audited financial statements.,[21], A further rebuttal might be that NPOs are constrained, by their choice of legal structure, from financial benefit as far as distribution of profit to members and directors is concerned.
,
,Tax exemption,[,edit,],
,In many countries, nonprofits may apply for ,tax-exempt, status, so that the organization itself may be exempt from income tax and other taxes. In the United States, to be exempt from federal income taxes, the organization must meet the requirements set forth in the ,Internal Revenue Code, (IRC). Granting nonprofit status is done by the state, while granting tax-exempt designation (such as IRC ,501(c),) is granted by the federal government via the IRS. This means that not all nonprofits are eligible to be tax-exempt.,[22], For example, employees of non-profit organizations pay taxes from their salaries, which they receive according to the laws of the country. NPOs use the model of a ,double bottom line, in that furthering their cause is more important than making a profit, though both are needed to ensure the organization's sustainability.,[23],[24], An advantage of nonprofits registered in the UK is that they benefit from some reliefs and exemptions. Charities and nonprofits are exempt from Corporation Tax as well as the trustees being exempt from Income Tax. ,[25],
,
,Problems,[,edit,],
,Founder's syndrome,[,edit,],
,Main article: ,Founder's syndrome,
,Founder's syndrome is an issue organizations experience as they expand. Dynamic founders, who have a strong vision of how to operate the project, try to retain control of the organization, even as new employees or volunteers want to expand the project's scope or change policy.,[26],
,
,Resource mismanagement,[,edit,],
,Resource mismanagement is a particular problem with NPOs because the employees are not accountable to anyone who has a direct stake in the organization. For example, an employee may start a new program without disclosing its complete liabilities. The employee may be rewarded for improving the NPO's reputation, making other employees happy, and attracting new donors. Liabilities promised on the full faith and credit of the organization but not recorded anywhere constitute ,accounting fraud,. But even indirect liabilities negatively affect the financial sustainability of the NPO, and the NPO will have financial problems unless strict controls are instated.,[27], Some commenters have argued that the receipt of significant funding from large for-profit corporations can ultimately alter the NPO's functions.,[28], A frequent measure of an NPO's efficiency is its ,expense ratio, (i.e. expenditures on things other than its programs, divided by its total expenditures).
,
,Competition for talent,[,edit,],
,Competition for employees with the public and ,private sector, is another problem that nonprofit organizations inevitably face, particularly for management positions. There are reports of major talent shortages in the nonprofit sector today regarding newly graduated workers,,[29], and NPOs have for too long,[,opinion,], relegated hiring to a secondary priority,,[30], which could be why they find themselves in the position many do. While many established NPOs are well-funded and comparative to their ,public sector, competitors, many more are independent and must be creative with which incentives they use to attract and maintain vibrant personalities. The initial interest for many is the remuneration package, though many who have been questioned after leaving an NPO have reported that it was stressful work environments and implacable work that drove them away.,[31],
,Public- and private-sector employment have, for the most part, been able to offer more to their employees than most nonprofit agencies throughout history. Either in the form of higher wages, more comprehensive benefit packages, or less tedious work, the public and private sectors have enjoyed an advantage over NPOs in attracting employees. Traditionally, the NPO has attracted mission-driven individuals who want to assist their chosen cause. Compounding the issue is that some NPOs do not operate in a manner similar to most businesses, or only seasonally. This leads many young and driven employees to forego NPOs in favor of more stable employment. Today, however, nonprofit organizations are adopting methods used by their competitors and finding new means to retain their employees and attract the best of the newly minted workforce.,[32],
,It has been mentioned that most nonprofits will never be able to match the pay of the private sector,[33], and therefore should focus their attention on benefits packages, incentives and implementing pleasurable work environments. A good environment is ranked higher than salary and pressure of work.,[30], NPOs are encouraged to pay as much as they are able and offer a low-stress work environment that the employee can associate him or herself positively with. Other incentives that should be implemented are generous vacation allowances or flexible work hours.,[34],
,
,Online presence,[,edit,],
,When selecting a ,domain name,, NPOs often use ,.org,, or the ,country code top-level domain, of their respective country, or the ,.edu, ,top-level domain, (TLD), to differentiate themselves from more commercial entities, which typically use ,.com,.
,In the traditional domain noted in ,.mw-parser-output cite.citation{font-style:inherit;word-wrap:break-word}.mw-parser-output .citation q{quotes:""\""""""\""""""'""""'""}.mw-parser-output .citation:target{background-color:rgba(0,127,255,0.133)}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-free.id-lock-free a{background:url(""//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Lock-green.svg"")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .id-lock-free a{background-size:contain}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-limited.id-lock-limited a,.mw-parser-output .id-lock-registration.id-lock-registration a{background:url(""//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Lock-gray-alt-2.svg"")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .id-lock-limited a,body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .id-lock-registration a{background-size:contain}.mw-parser-output .id-lock-subscription.id-lock-subscription a{background:url(""//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/Lock-red-alt-2.svg"")right 0.1em center/9px no-repeat}body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .id-lock-subscription a{background-size:contain}.mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon a{background:url(""//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg"")right 0.1em center/12px no-repeat}body:not(.skin-timeless):not(.skin-minerva) .mw-parser-output .cs1-ws-icon a{background-size:contain}.mw-parser-output .cs1-code{color:inherit;background:inherit;border:none;padding:inherit}.mw-parser-output .cs1-hidden-error{display:none;color:#d33}.mw-parser-output .cs1-visible-error{color:#d33}.mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{display:none;color:#2C882D;margin-left:0.3em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-format{font-size:95%}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-left{padding-left:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .cs1-kern-right{padding-right:0.2em}.mw-parser-output .citation .mw-selflink{font-weight:inherit}html.skin-theme-clientpref-night .mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{color:#18911F}html.skin-theme-clientpref-night .mw-parser-output .cs1-visible-error,html.skin-theme-clientpref-night .mw-parser-output .cs1-hidden-error{color:#f8a397}@media(prefers-color-scheme:dark){html.skin-theme-clientpref-os .mw-parser-output .cs1-visible-error,html.skin-theme-clientpref-os .mw-parser-output .cs1-hidden-error{color:#f8a397}html.skin-theme-clientpref-os .mw-parser-output .cs1-maint{color:#18911F}},RFC, ,1591,, .org is for ""organizations that didn't fit anywhere else"" in the naming system, which implies that it is the proper category for non-commercial organizations if they are not governmental, educational, or one of the other types with a specific TLD. It is not designated specifically for charitable organizations or any specific organizational or tax-law status, but encompasses anything that is not classifiable as another category. Currently, no restrictions are enforced on registration of .com or .org, so one can find organizations of all sorts in either of those domains, as well as other top-level domains including newer, more specific ones which may apply to particular sorts of organization including ,.museum, for museums and ,.coop, for ,cooperatives,. Organizations might also register by the appropriate country code top-level domain for their country.
,
,Alternative names,[,edit,],
,Some organizations offer new, positive-sounding alternative terminology to describe the sector. The term ,civil society organization, (CSO) has been used by a growing number of organizations, including the ,Center for the Study of Global Governance,.,[35], The term ,citizen sector organization, (CSO) has also been advocated to describe the sector – as one of citizens, for citizens – by organizations including ,Ashoka: Innovators for the Public,.,[36], Advocates argue that these terms describe the sector in its own terms, without relying on terminology used for the government or business sectors. However, use of terminology by a nonprofit of self-descriptive language that is not legally compliant risks confusing the public about nonprofit abilities, capabilities, and limitations.,[37],

,Founded in 1982, ,Rough Guides Ltd, is a British publisher of print and digital ,guide book,, phrasebooks and inspirational travel reference books, and a provider of personalised trips. Since November 2017,,[1], Rough Guides has been owned by APA Publications UK Ltd, the parent company of Insight Guides.
,With the company's personalised trip service encompassing over eighty destinations, and 200 guidebooks covering 180 destinations, Rough Guides is a multi-faceted travel platform, with global sales of 100 million guidebooks since their inception.
,
,
,Company history,[,edit,],
,The first Rough Guide, ,The Rough Guide to Greece,,,[2], was conceived and written by Rough Guides’ founder Mark Ellingham in response to a gap in the market for well-written guidebooks offering practical, low-budget information. Published by Routledge & Kegan Paul in 1982, the guide's popularity resulted in Ellingham being made Series Editor and commissioning more guidebooks.
,In the mid-1980s, Ellingham and three fellow editors, John Fisher, Jack Holland and Martin Dunford, bought the Rough Guides titles from Routledge and set-up as an independent publisher. By the early 1990s, around 100 Rough Guides were in print. With detailed cultural and historical coverage, a contemporary journalistic approach, extensive maps, and practical advice, the guides gained a following among travellers seeking authentic experiences.
,At the same time, the company expanded to cover a broader range of topics, with an early guide to the Internet selling over four million copies. 
The company also contributed to developing a BBC TV series, Rough Guides, which ran for almost a decade. Later editions of the show, usually hosted by ,Magenta Devine,, were repeated on the Sky Travel channel until 2005.
,In 1995, when Rough Guides were selling around a million books a year, Mark Ellingham entered into a pioneering agreement with HotWired Ventures, the digital offshoot of Wired Ventures, the then-publisher of ,WIRED, magazine. The deal offered free online access to the full text of ,The Rough Guide to the USA, via the World Beat section of ,HotWired,. Ellingham stated at the time that publishing the guides online would facilitate easier updates. ""If you could send me an e-mail from Senegal saying this hotel's closed down, I would just key it in,"" he told the ,San Francisco Chronicle,. ""The online book would take on a life of its own"".,[3],
,In 1995 the company was sold to ,Penguin Books,, which was already managing book distribution. Initially, Penguin bought half the company's shares. When the process was completed in 2002, Rough Guides was integrated into Penguin's travel division.
,In May 2007, Mark Ellingham said he had grave concerns about the growth of air travel because of its growing contribution to climate change. He launched an awareness campaign with ,Tony Wheeler, (,Lonely Planet, founder), and Rough Guides began including a ""health warning"" in each of its travel guides, urging readers to ""Fly less, stay longer"".,[4], In November 2007, after celebrating ""25 Rough Years"" with a series of celebratory books, Ellingham left Rough Guides to set up a new imprint, GreenProfile, at ,Profile Books,.,[5],
,In 2017, APA Publications purchased Rough Guides.
,Since April 2019, Rough Guides have offered a free downloadable eBook with every purchase of a print guide.
,
,Rough Guides products,[,edit,],
,Travel guides, phrasebooks and Inspiration books,[,edit,],
,Travel guides continue to be a key component of Rough Guides, with over 100 million copies sold worldwide. The current list comprises 200 guidebooks covering 180 destinations. Purchase of any Rough Guide offers free access to an eBook edition of the same content.
,Covering countries, cities and regions, books in the main Rough Guides series provide travellers with practical area-by-area information, with maps, recommendations, and cultural and historical contexts.
,Rough Guides also publish pocket guides and mini guides covering global destinations. Guidebooks in the British Breaks series cover UK cities, coastal areas and islands. Rough Guides’ Staycation series covers UK destinations in a pocket format, with a focus on walking and driving routes.
,Rough Guides phrasebooks are published in a pocket-sized format, with a 7000-word bilingual dictionary and free app.
Rough Guides’ large format, photographic Inspiration series includes ,The Rough Guide to the 100 Best Places on Earth,, ,The Rough Guide to the 100 Best Places in the USA,, and ,The Rough Guide to the 100 Best Places in Scotland,.
,In 2023, Rough Guides launched a personalised gift book service.
,
,Personalised trips,[,edit,],
,In November 2018, Rough Guides launched a personalised trip service.,[6], Allowing travellers to plan and book personalised trips, this platform receives more than six million visitors a year, with the trip-booking service covering more than 80 destinations, supported by over 60 local experts.
,
,Awards,[,edit,],
,From 2017 to 2020 Rough Guides ran an award-winning podcast, ,The Rough Guide to Everywhere,.,[7], This explored topical travel issues, and showcased interviews with travel personalities. In 2019, ,The Rough Guide to Everywhere, was nominated for the Best Branded Podcast category at The British Podcast Awards.[11]
,In 2018, Rough Guides was nominated for two categories in the Travel Media Awards – Broadcast Programme of the Year, with former editor Zara Sekhavati nominated for Young Writer of the Year. In addition, APA Publications’ Berlitz Cruising & Cruise Ships 2018 won Guide of the Year.
,In 2022, Amy Hopkins, Rough Guides’ Head of Content, won a PPA ,Professional Publishers Association, Newcomer of the Year Award.
,Also in 2022, Rough Guides was a finalist in the Guide of the Year category at the Travel Media Awards.
,2023 saw Rough Guides shortlisted for the TravMedia Travel Magazine of the Year Award.

,A ,gift economy, or ,gift culture, is a system of exchange where ,valuables, are not sold, but rather given without an explicit agreement for immediate or future rewards.,[1], Social norms and customs govern giving a gift in a gift culture; although there is some expectation of reciprocity, gifts are not given in an explicit exchange of goods or services for ,money,, or some other ,commodity, or service.,[2], This contrasts with a ,barter economy, or a ,market economy,, where ,goods and services, are primarily explicitly exchanged for value received.
,The nature of gift economies is the subject of a foundational debate in ,anthropology,. Anthropological research into gift economies began with ,Bronisław Malinowski,'s description of the ,Kula ring,[3], in the ,Trobriand Islands, during ,World War I,.,[4], The Kula trade appeared to be gift-like since Trobrianders would travel great distances over dangerous seas to give what were considered valuable objects without any guarantee of a return. Malinowski's debate with the French anthropologist ,Marcel Mauss, quickly established the complexity of ""gift exchange"" and introduced a series of technical terms such as ,reciprocity,, ,inalienable possessions,, and presentation to distinguish between the different forms of exchange.,[5],[6],
,According to anthropologists ,Maurice Bloch, and Jonathan Parry, it is the unsettled relationship between market and non-market exchange that attracts the most attention. Some authors argue that gift economies build community,,[7], while markets harm community relationships.,[8],
,Gift exchange is distinguished from other forms of exchange by a number of principles, such as the form of property rights governing the articles exchanged; whether gifting forms a distinct ""sphere of exchange"" that can be characterized as an ""economic system""; and the character of the social relationship that the gift exchange establishes. Gift ideology in highly commercialized societies differs from the ""prestations"" typical of non-market societies. Gift economies also differ from related phenomena, such as ,common property, regimes and the exchange of non-commodified labour.
,
,
,Principles of gift exchange,[,edit,],
,According to anthropologist Jonathan Parry, discussion on the nature of gifts, and of a separate sphere of gift exchange that would constitute an economic system, has been plagued by the ,ethnocentric, use of a modern, western, market society-based conception of the gift applied as if it were a universal across culture and time. However, he claims that anthropologists, through analysis of a variety of cultural and historical forms of exchange, have established that no universal practice exists.,[9], Similarly, the idea of a ,pure gift, is ""most likely to arise in highly differentiated societies with an advanced division of labour and a significant commercial sector"" and need to be distinguished from non-market ""prestations"".,[10], According to Weiner, to speak of a gift economy in a non-market society is to ignore the distinctive features of their exchange relationships, as the early classic debate between ,Bronislaw Malinowski, and ,Marcel Mauss, demonstrated.,[5],[6], Gift exchange is frequently "",embedded,"" in political, kin, or religious institutions, and therefore does not constitute an ,economic, system per se.,[11],
,
,Property and alienability,[,edit,],
,Gift-giving is a form of transfer of property rights over particular objects. The nature of those property rights varies from society to society, from culture to culture. They are not universal. The nature of gift-giving is thus altered by the type of property regime in place.,[12],
,Property is not a thing, but a relationship amongst people about things.,[13], It is a social relationship that governs the conduct of people with respect to the use and disposition of things. Anthropologists analyze these relationships in terms of a variety of actors' (individual or corporate) ,bundle of rights, over objects.,[12], An example is the current debates around ,intellectual property rights,.,[14],[15],[16],[17], Take a purchased book over which the author retains a copyright. Although the book is a commodity, bought and sold, it has not been completely alienated from its creator, who maintains a hold over it; the owner of the book is limited in what he can do with the book by the rights of the creator.,[18],[19], Weiner has argued that the ability to give while retaining a right to the gift/commodity is a critical feature of the gifting cultures described by Malinowski and Mauss, and explains, for example, why some gifts such as Kula valuables return to their original owners after an incredible journey around the Trobriand islands. The gifts given in Kula exchange still remain, in some respects, the property of the giver.,[6],
,In the example used above, copyright is one of those bundled rights that regulate the use and disposition of a book. Gift-giving in many societies is complicated because private property owned by an individual may be quite limited in scope (see ,§ The commons, below).,[12], Productive resources, such as land, may be held by members of a corporate group (such as a lineage), but only some members of that group may have ,use rights,. When many people hold rights over the same objects, gifting has very different implications than the gifting of private property; only some of the rights in that object may be transferred, leaving that object still tied to its corporate owners. As such, these types of objects are ,inalienable possessions,, simultaneously kept while given.,[6],
,
,Gift versus prestation,[,edit,],
,A Kula necklace, with its distinctive red shell-disc beads, from the Trobriand Islands,
,Malinowski's study of the ,Kula ring,[20], became the subject of debate with the French anthropologist, Marcel Mauss, author of "",The Gift,"" (""Essai sur le don"", 1925).,[5], Parry argued that Malinowski emphasized the exchange of goods between ,individuals,, and their selfish motives for gifting: they expected a return of equal or greater value. Malinowski argued that ,reciprocity, is an implicit part of gifting, that there is no gift free of expectation.,[21],
,In contrast, Mauss emphasized that the gifts were not between individuals, but between representatives of larger collectives. These gifts were a ,total prestation,, a service provided out of obligation, like community service.,[22], They were not alienable commodities to be bought and sold, but, like ,crown jewels,, embodied the reputation, history and identity of a ""corporate kin group"", such as a line of kings. Given the stakes, Mauss asked ""why anyone would give them away?"" His answer was an enigmatic concept, ,the spirit of the gift., Parry believes that much of the confusion (and resulting debate) was due to a bad translation. Mauss appeared to be arguing that a return gift is given to maintain the relationship between givers; a failure to return a gift ends the relationship and the promise of any future gifts.
,Both Malinowski and Mauss agreed that in non-market societies, where there was no clear institutionalized economic exchange system, gift/prestation exchange served economic, kinship, religious and political functions that could not be clearly distinguished from each other, and which mutually influenced the nature of the practice.,[21],
,
,Inalienable possessions,[,edit,],
,Watercolor by ,James G. Swan, depicting the ,Klallam, people of chief ,Chetzemoka, at ,Port Townsend,, with one of Chetzemoka's wives distributing ,potlatch,
,The concept of total prestations was further developed by Annette Weiner, who revisited Malinowski's fieldsite in the Trobriand Islands. Her critique was twofold. First, Trobriand Island society is matrilineal, and women hold much economic and political power, but their exchanges were ignored by Malinowski. Secondly, she developed Mauss' argument about reciprocity and the ""spirit of the gift"" in terms of "",inalienable possessions,: the paradox of keeping while giving"".,[6], Weiner contrasted moveable goods, which can be exchanged, with immoveable goods that serve to draw the gifts back (in the Trobriand case, male Kula gifts with women's landed property). The goods given on the islands are so linked to particular groups that even when given away, they are not truly alienated. Such goods depend on the existence of particular kinds of kinship groups in society.
,French anthropologist Maurice Godelier,[23], continued this analysis in ,The Enigma of the Gift, (1999). Albert Schrauwers argued that the kinds of societies used as examples by Weiner and Godelier (including the ,Kula ring, in the Trobriands, the ,Potlatch, of the ,indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast,, and the ,Toraja, of ,South Sulawesi,, ,Indonesia,) are all characterized by ranked aristocratic kin groups that fit ,Claude Lévi-Strauss,' model of ,House Societies, (where ,house, refers to both noble lineage and their landed estate). Total prestations are given to preserve landed estates identified with particular kin groups and maintain their place in a ranked society.,[24],
,
,Reciprocity and the spirit of the gift,[,edit,],
,Chris Gregory, argued that ,reciprocity, is a dyadic exchange relationship that we characterize, imprecisely, as gift-giving. Gregory argued that one gives gifts to friends and potential enemies in order to establish a relationship, by placing them in debt. He also claimed that in order for such a relationship to persist, there must be a time lag between the gift and counter-gift; one or the other partner must always be in debt. Marshall Sahlins gave birthday gifts as an example. They are separated in time so that one partner feels the obligation to make a return gift. To forget the return gift may be enough to end the relationship. Gregory stated that without a relationship of debt, there is no reciprocity, and that this is what distinguishes a gift economy from a ,true, gift, given with no expectation of return (something Sahlins ,generalised reciprocity;, see below).,[25],
,Marshall Sahlins,, an American cultural anthropologist, identified three main types of reciprocity in his book ,Stone Age Economics, (1972). Gift or ,generalized reciprocity, is the exchange of goods and services without keeping track of their exact value, but often with the expectation that their value will balance out over time. ,Balanced or Symmetrical reciprocity, occurs when someone gives to someone else, expecting a fair and tangible return at a specified amount, time, and place. Market or ,negative reciprocity, is the exchange of goods and services where each party intends to profit from the exchange, often at the expense of the other. Gift economies, or generalized reciprocity, occurred within closely knit kin groups, and the more distant the exchange partner, the more balanced or negative the exchange became.,[26],
,
,Charity, debt, and the ""poison of the gift"",[,edit,],
,Jonathan Parry argued that ideologies of the ""pure gift"" are most likely to arise only in highly differentiated societies with an advanced division of labour and a significant commercial sector"" and need to be distinguished from the non-market ""prestations"" discussed above.,[10], Parry also underscored, using the example of charitable giving of alms in India (,Dāna,), that the ""pure gift"" of alms given with no expectation of return could be ""poisonous"". That is, the gift of alms embodying the sins of the giver, when given to ritually pure priests, saddled these priests with impurities of which they could not cleanse themselves. ""Pure gifts"", given without a return, can place recipients in debt, and hence in dependent status: the poison of the gift.,[27], ,David Graeber, points out that no reciprocity is expected between unequals: if you make a gift of a dollar to a beggar, he will not give it back the next time you meet. More than likely, he will ask for more, to the detriment of his status.,[28], Many who are forced by circumstances to accept charity feel stigmatized. In the ,Moka exchange, system of Papua New Guinea, where gift givers become political ""big men"", those who are in their debt and unable to repay with ""interest"" are referred to as ""rubbish men"".
,The French writer ,Georges Bataille,, in ,La part Maudite,, uses Mauss's argument in order to construct a theory of economy: the structure of gift is the presupposition for all possible economy. Bataille is particularly interested in the potlatch as described by Mauss, and claims that its agonistic character obliges the receiver to confirm their own subjection. Thus gifting embodies the Hegelian dipole of master and slave within the act.

,The relationship of new market exchange systems to indigenous non-market exchange remained a perplexing question for anthropologists. ,Paul Bohannan, argued that the Tiv of Nigeria had three ,spheres of exchange,, and that only certain kinds of goods could be exchanged in each sphere; each sphere had its own form of special-purpose money. However, the market and universal money allowed goods to be traded between spheres and thus damaged established social relationships.,[29], Jonathan Parry and ,Maurice Bloch, argued in ""Money and the Morality of Exchange"" (1989), that the ""transactional order"" through which long-term social reproduction of the family occurs has to be preserved as separate from short-term market relations.,[30], It is the long-term social reproduction of the family that is sacralized by religious rituals such baptisms, weddings and funerals, and characterized by gifting.
,In such situations where gift-giving and market exchange were intersecting for the first time, some anthropologists contrasted them as polar opposites. This opposition was classically expressed by Chris Gregory in his book ""Gifts and Commodities"" (1982). Gregory argued that:

Gift exchange is an exchange of ,inalienable, objects between people who are in a state of reciprocal ,dependence, that establishes a ,qualitative, relationship between the ,transactors, (emphasis added).,[31],
,Gregory contrasts gift and commodity exchange according to five criteria:,[32],
,
,

,
,Commodity exchange,
,Gift exchange
,
,
,immediate exchange,
,delayed exchange
,
,
,alienable goods,
,inalienable goods
,
,
,actors independent,
,actors dependent
,
,

,
,But other anthropologists refused to see these different "",exchange spheres,"" as such polar opposites. ,Marilyn Strathern,, writing on a similar area in Papua New Guinea, dismissed the utility of the contrasting setup in ""The Gender of the Gift"" (1988).,[33],
,
,Wedding rings could be considered a commodity, pure gift, or both.,
,Rather than emphasize how particular kinds of objects are either gifts or commodities to be traded in ,restricted, spheres of exchange, ,Arjun Appadurai, and others began to look at how objects flowed between these spheres of exchange (i.e. how objects can be converted into gifts and then back into commodities). They refocussed attention away from the character of the human relationships formed through exchange, and placed it on ""the social life of things"" instead. They examined the strategies by which an object could be "",singularized,"" (made unique, special, one-of-a-kind) and so withdrawn from the market. A marriage ceremony that transforms a purchased ring into an irreplaceable family heirloom is one example; the heirloom, in turn, makes a perfect gift. Singularization is the reverse of the seemingly irresistible process of commodification. They thus show how all economies are a constant flow of material objects that enter and leave specific exchange spheres. A similar approach is taken by Nicholas Thomas, who examines the same range of cultures and the anthropologists who write on them, and redirects attention to the ""entangled objects"" and their roles as both gifts and commodities.,[34],
,
,Proscriptions,[,edit,],
,Many societies have strong prohibitions against turning gifts into trade or ,capital, goods. Anthropologist Wendy James writes that among the ,Uduk people, of northeast ,Africa, there is a strong custom that any gift that crosses subclan boundaries must be consumed rather than invested.,[35],: 4 , For example, an animal given as a gift must be eaten, not bred. However, as in the example of the Trobriand armbands and necklaces, this ""perishing"" may not consist of consumption as such, but of the gift moving on. In other societies, it is a matter of giving some other gift, either directly in return or to another party. To keep the gift and not give another in exchange is reprehensible. ""In folk tales,"" ,Lewis Hyde, remarks, ""the person who tries to hold onto a gift usually dies."",[35],: 5 ,
,Daniel Everett,, a linguist who studied the small ,Pirahã tribe, of hunter-gatherers in Brazil,,[36], reported that, while they are aware of ,food preservation, using drying, salting, and so forth, they reserve their use for items bartered outside the tribe. Within the group, when someone has a successful hunt they immediately share the abundance by inviting others to enjoy a feast. Asked about this practice, one hunter laughed and replied, ""I store meat in the belly of my brother."",[37],[38],
,Carol Stack's ,All Our Kin, describes both the positive and negative sides of a network of obligation and gratitude effectively constituting a gift economy. Her narrative of ,The Flats,, a poor ,Chicago, neighborhood, tells in passing the story of two sisters who each came into a small inheritance. One sister hoarded the inheritance and prospered materially for some time, but was alienated from the community. Her marriage broke up, and she integrated herself back into the community largely by giving gifts. The other sister fulfilled the community's expectations, but within six weeks had nothing material to show for the inheritance but a coat and a pair of shoes.,[35],: 75–76 ,
,
,Case studies: prestations,[,edit,],
,Marcel Mauss was careful to distinguish ""gift economies"" (reciprocity) in market societies from the ""total prestations"" given in non-market societies. A prestation is a service provided out of obligation, like ""community service"".,[22], These ""prestations"" bring together domains across political, religious, legal, moral and economic definitions, such that the exchange can be seen to be ,embedded, in non-economic social institutions. These prestations are often competitive, as in the ,potlatch,, ,Kula exchange,, and ,Moka exchange,.,[39],
,
,Moka exchange in Papua New Guinea: competitive exchange,[,edit,],
,.mw-parser-output .hatnote{font-style:italic}.mw-parser-output div.hatnote{padding-left:1.6em;margin-bottom:0.5em}.mw-parser-output .hatnote i{font-style:normal}.mw-parser-output .hatnote+link+.hatnote{margin-top:-0.5em},Main article: ,Moka exchange,
,Mount Hagen,, Papua New Guinea,
,The ,Moka, is a highly ritualized system of exchange in the ,Mount Hagen, area of ,Papua New Guinea,, that has become emblematic of the anthropological concepts of a ""gift economy"" and of a "",big man,"" political system. Moka are reciprocal gifts that raise the social status of the giver if the gift is larger than one that the giver received. ,Moka, refers specifically to the increment in the size of the gift.,[40], The gifts are of a limited range of goods, primarily pigs and scarce pearl shells from the coast. To return the same value as one has received in a moka is simply to repay a debt, strict reciprocity. Moka is the extra. To some, this represents interest on an investment. However, one is not bound to provide moka, only to repay the debt. One adds moka to the gift to increase one's prestige, and to place the receiver in debt. It is this constant renewal of the debt relationship which keeps the relationship alive; a debt fully paid off ends further interaction. Giving more than one receives establishes a reputation as a Big man, whereas the simple repayment of debt, or failure to fully repay, pushes one's reputation towards the other end of the scale, ""rubbish man"".,[41], Gift exchange thus has a political effect; granting prestige or status to one, and a sense of debt in the other. A political system can be built out of these kinds of status relationships. Sahlins characterizes the difference between status and rank by highlighting that Big man is not a role; it is a status that is shared by many. The Big man is ""not a prince ,of, men"", but a ""prince among men"". The ""big man"" system is based on the ability to persuade, rather than command.,[42],
,
,Toraja funerals: the politics of meat distribution,[,edit,],
,Three ,tongkonan, noble houses in a Torajan village,
,Slaughter of swine at a funeral,
,The ,Toraja, are an ,ethnic group, ,indigenous, to a mountainous region of ,South Sulawesi,, Indonesia.,[43], Torajans are renowned for their elaborate funeral rites, burial sites carved into rocky cliffs, and massive peaked-roof traditional houses known as ,tongkonan, which are owned by noble families. Membership in a tongkonan is inherited by all descendants of its founders. Thus any individual may be a member of numerous tongkonan, as long as they contribute to its ritual events. Membership in a tongkonan carries benefits, such as the right to rent some of its rice fields.,[44],
,Toraja funeral rites are important social events, usually attended by hundreds of people and lasting several days. The funerals are like ""big men"" competitions where all the descendants of a tongkonan compete through gifts of sacrificial cattle. Participants have invested cattle with others over the years, and draw on those extended networks to make the largest gift. The winner of the competition becomes the new owner of the tongkonan and its rice lands. They display all the cattle horns from their winning sacrifice on a pole in front of the tongkonan.,[44],
,The Toraja funeral differs from the ""big man"" system in that the winner of the ""gift"" exchange gains control of the Tongkonan's property. It creates a clear social hierarchy between the noble owners of the tongkonan and its land, and the commoners who are forced to rent their fields from him. Since the owners of the tongkonan gain rent, they are better able to compete in the funeral gift exchanges, and their social rank is more stable than the ""big man"" system.,[44],
,
,Charity and alms giving,[,edit,],
,Main article: ,Alms,
,Anthropologist ,David Graeber, argued that the great world religious traditions of charity and gift giving emerged almost simultaneously during the ,Axial Age, (800 to 200 BCE), when coinage was invented and market economies were established on a continental basis. Graeber argues that these charity traditions emerged as a reaction against the nexus formed by coinage, slavery, military violence and the market (a ""military-coinage"" complex). The new world religions, including ,Hinduism,, ,Judaism,, ,Buddhism,, ,Confucianism,, ,Christianity,, and ,Islam, all sought to preserve ""human economies"" where money served to cement social relationships rather than purchase things (including people).,[45],
,Charity and alms-giving are religiously sanctioned voluntary gifts given without expectation of return. However, case studies show that such gifting is not necessarily altruistic.,[46],
,
,Merit making in Buddhist Thailand,[,edit,],
,Young Burmese monk,
,Theravada Buddhism, in ,Thailand, emphasizes the importance of giving alms (,merit making,) without any intention of return (a pure gift), which is best accomplished according to doctrine, through gifts to monks and temples. The emphasis is on the selfless gifting which ""earns merit"" (and a future better life) for the giver rather than on the relief of the poor or the recipient on whom the gift is bestowed. However, Bowie's research shows that this ideal form of gifting is limited to the rich who have the resources to endow temples and sponsor the ordination of monks.,[47], Monks come from these same families, so this gifting doctrine has a class element. Poorer farmers place much less emphasis on merit making through gifts to monks and temples. They equally validate gifting to beggars. Poverty and famine is widespread among these poorer groups, and by validating gift-giving to beggars, they are in fact demanding that the rich see to their needs in hard times. Bowie sees this as an example of a ,moral economy, (see below) in which the poor use gossip and reputation to resist elite exploitation and pressure them to ease their ""this world"" suffering.,[48],
,
,Charity: Dana in India,[,edit,],
,Dāna, is a form of religious charity given in Hindu India. The gift is said to embody the sins of the giver (the ""poison of the gift""), whom it frees of evil by transmitting it to the recipient. The merit of the gift depends on finding a worthy recipient such as a ,Brahmin, priest. Priests are supposed to be able to digest the sin through ritual action and transmit the gift with increment to someone of greater worth. It is imperative that this be a true gift, with no reciprocity, or the evil will return. The gift is not intended to create any relationship between donor and recipient, and there should never be a return gift. Dana thus transgresses the so-called universal ""norm of reciprocity"".,[10],
,
,The Children of Peace in Canada,[,edit,],
,Sharon Temple,
,The Children of Peace, (1812–1889) were a utopian Quaker sect. Today, they are primarily remembered for the ,Sharon Temple,, a national historic site and an architectural symbol of their vision of a society based on the values of peace, equality and social justice. They built this ornate temple to raise money for the poor, and built the province of Ontario's first shelter for the homeless. They took a lead role in organizing the province's first co-operative, ,the Farmers' Storehouse,, and opened the province's first ,credit union,. The group soon found that the charity they tried to distribute from their Temple fund endangered the poor. Accepting charity was a sign of indebtedness, and the ,debtor could be jailed without trial at the time,; this was the ""poison of the gift"". They thus transformed their charity fund into a credit union that loaned small sums like today's micro-credit institutions. This is an example of ,singularization,, as money was transformed into charity in the Temple ceremony, then shifted to an alternative exchange sphere as a loan. Interest on the loan was then singularized, and transformed back into charity.,[49],
,
,Gifting as non-commodified exchange in market societies,[,edit,],
,Non-commodified spheres of exchange exist in relation to the market economy. They are created through the processes of ,singularization, as specific objects are de-commodified for a variety of reasons and enter an alternative ,exchange sphere,. It may be in opposition to the market and to its perceived greed. It may also be used by corporations as a means of creating a sense of endebtedness and loyalty in customers. Modern marketing techniques often aim at infusing commodity exchange with features of gift exchange, thus blurring the presumably sharp distinction between gifts and commodities.,[50],
,
,Organ transplant networks, sperm and blood banks,[,edit,],
,Blood donation poster, WWII,
,Main article: ,Organ gifting,
,Market economies tend to ""reduce everything – including human beings, their labor, and their reproductive capacity – to the status of commodities"".,[51], ""The rapid transfer of organ transplant technology to the third world has created a trade in organs, with sick bodies travelling to the ,Global South, for transplants, and healthy organs from the Global South being transported to the richer Global North, ""creating a kind of 'Kula ring' of bodies and body parts."",[52], However, all commodities can also be singularized, or de-commodified, and transformed into gifts. In North America, it is illegal to sell organs, and citizens are enjoined to give the ""gift of life"" and donate their organs in an organ gift economy.,[53], However, this gift economy is a ""medical realm rife with potent forms of mystified commodification"".,[54], This multimillion-dollar medical industry requires clients to pay steep fees for the gifted organ, which creates clear class divisions between those who donate (often in the global south) and will never benefit from gifted organs, and those who can pay the fees and thereby receive a gifted organ.,[53],
,Unlike body organs, blood and semen have been successfully and legally commodified in the United States. Blood and semen can thus be commodified, but once consumed are ""the gift of life"". Although both can be either donated or sold, are perceived as the ""gift of life"" yet are stored in ""banks"", and can be collected only under strict government regulated procedures, recipients very clearly prefer altruistically donated semen and blood. The blood and semen samples with the highest market value are those that have been altruistically donated. The recipients view semen as storing the potential characteristics of their unborn child in its DNA, and value altruism over greed.,[55], Similarly, gifted blood is the archetype of a pure gift relationship because the donor is only motivated by a desire to help others.,[56],[57],

,Copyleft vs copyright: the gift of ""free"" speech,[,edit,],
,Main article: ,Copyleft,
,Engineers, scientists and software developers have created ,free software, projects such as the ,Linux kernel, and the ,GNU, operating system. They are prototypical examples for the gift economy's prominence in the technology sector, and its active role in instating the use of ,permissive free software, and ,copyleft, licenses, which allow free reuse of software and knowledge. Other examples include ,file-sharing,, ,open access,, ,unlicensed, software and so on.
,
,Points and loyalty programs,[,edit,],
,Main article: ,Loyalty program,
,Many retail organizations have ""gift"" programs meant to encourage customer loyalty to their establishments. Bird-David and Darr refer to these as hybrid ""mass-gifts"" which are neither gift nor commodity. They are called mass-gifts because they are given away in large numbers ""free with purchase"" in a mass-consumption environment. They give as an example two bars of soap in which one is given free with purchase: which is the commodity and which the gift? The mass-gift both affirms the distinct difference between gift and commodity while confusing it at the same time. As with gifting, mass-gifts are used to create a social relationship. Some customers embrace the relationship and gift whereas others reject the gift relationship and interpret the ""gift"" as a 50% off sale.,[58],

,Free shops,[,edit,],
,Main article: ,Give-away shop,
,Inside ,Utrecht, Giveaway shop. The banner reads ""The earth has enough for everyone's need, but not for everyone's greed"".,
,"",Give-away shops,"", ""freeshops"" or ""free stores"" are stores where all goods are free. They are similar to ,charity shops,, with mostly second-hand items – only everything is available at no cost. Whether it is a ,book,, a piece of ,furniture,, a garment or a ,household, item, it is all freely given away, although some operate a one-in, one-out–type policy (swap shops). The free store is a form of constructive ,direct action, that provides a shopping alternative to a ,monetary, framework, allowing people to exchange goods and services outside a money-based economy. The anarchist ,1960s countercultural, group ,The Diggers,[59], opened ,free stores, which gave away their stock, provided free food, distributed free drugs, gave away money, organized free music concerts, and performed works of political art.,[60], The Diggers took their name from the original ,English Diggers, led by ,Gerrard Winstanley,[61], and sought to create a mini-society free of money and ,capitalism,.,[62],

,Burning Man, is a week-long annual art and community event held in the Black Rock Desert in northern ,Nevada,, in the United States. The event is described as an experiment in community, radical self-expression, and radical self-reliance. The event forbids commerce (except for ice, coffee, and tickets to the event itself),[63], and encourages gifting.,[64], Gifting is one of the 10 guiding principles,,[65], as participants to Burning Man (both the desert festival and the year-round global community) are encouraged to rely on a gift economy. The practice of gifting at Burning Man is also documented by the 2002 documentary film ,Gifting It: A Burning Embrace of Gift Economy,,,[66], as well as by Making Contact's radio show ""How We Survive: The Currency of Giving [encore]"".,[64],

,Cannabis market in the District of Columbia and U.S. states,[,edit,],
,Main article: ,Cannabis in Washington, D.C.,
,According to the Associated Press, ""Gift-giving has long been a part of marijuana culture"" and has accompanied legalization in U.S. states in the 2010s.,[67], Voters in the ,District of Columbia, legalized the growing of ,cannabis, for personal recreational use by approving ,Initiative 71, in November 2014, but the 2015 "",Cromnibus,"" Federal appropriations bills prevented the District from creating a system to allow for its commercial sale. Possession, growth, and use of the drug by adults is legal in the District, as is giving it away, but sale and barter of it is not, in effect attempting to create a gift economy.,[68], However it ended up creating a commercial market linked to selling other objects.,[69], Preceding the January, 2018 legalization of cannabis possession in Vermont without a corresponding legal framework for sales, it was expected that a similar market would emerge there.,[70], For a time, people in Portland, Oregon, could only legally obtain cannabis as a gift, which was celebrated in the ,Burnside Burn, rally.,[71], For a time, a similar situation ensued after possession was legalized in California, Maine and Massachusetts.,[67],[72],[73],

,Mutual aid,[,edit,],
,Main article: ,Mutual aid (organization theory),
,The Conquest of Bread, by Peter Kropotkin, influential work which presents the economic vision of ,anarcho-communism,
,Many anarchists, particularly ,anarcho-primitivists, and ,anarcho-communists,, believe that variations on a gift economy may be the key to breaking the ,cycle of poverty,. Therefore, they often desire to refashion all of society into a gift economy. Anarcho-communists advocate a gift economy as an ideal, with neither money, nor markets, nor planning. This view traces back at least to ,Peter Kropotkin,, who saw in the hunter-gatherer tribes he had visited the paradigm of "",mutual aid,"".,[74], In place of a market, ,anarcho-communists,, such as those who lived in some Spanish villages in the 1930s, support a gift economy without currency, where goods and services are produced by workers and distributed in community stores where everyone (including the workers who produced them) is essentially entitled to consume whatever they want or need as payment for their production of goods and services.,[75],
,As an intellectual abstraction, mutual aid was developed and advanced by ,mutualism, or labor ,insurance, systems and thus ,trade unions,, and has been also used in ,cooperatives, and other ,civil society, movements. Typically, mutual-aid groups are free to join and participate in, and all activities are ,voluntary,. Often they are structured as ,non-hierarchical,, ,non-bureaucratic, ,non-profit organizations,, with members controlling all resources and no external financial or professional support. They are member-led and member-organized. They are egalitarian in nature, and designed to support ,participatory democracy,, ,equality, of member status and power, and shared ,leadership, and ,cooperative decision-making,. Members' external societal status is considered irrelevant inside the group: status in the group is conferred by participation.,[76],
,
,Moral economy,[,edit,],
,English historian ,E.P. Thompson, wrote about the ,moral economy, of the poor in the context of widespread English food riots in the English countryside in the late 18th century. Thompson claimed that these riots were generally peaceable acts that demonstrated a common political culture rooted in feudal rights to ""set the price"" of essential goods in the market. These peasants believed that a traditional ""fair price"" was more important to the community than a ""free"" market price and they punished large farmers who sold their surpluses at higher prices outside the village while some village members still needed produce. Thus a moral economy is an attempt to preserve an alternative exchange sphere from market penetration.,[77],[78], The notion of peasants with a non-capitalist cultural mentality using the market for their own ends has been linked to subsistence agriculture and the need for subsistence insurance in hard times. However, James C. Scott points out that those who provide this subsistence insurance to the poor in bad years are wealthy patrons who exact a political cost for their aid; this aid is given to recruit followers. The concept of moral economy has been used to explain why peasants in a number of colonial contexts, such as the Vietnam War, have rebelled.,[79],
,
,The commons,[,edit,],
,Main article: ,Commons,
,Some may confuse common property regimes with gift exchange systems. The commons is the cultural and natural resources accessible to all members of a society, including natural materials such as air, water, and a habitable earth. These resources are held in common, not owned privately.,[80], The resources held in common can include everything from ,natural resources, and ,common land, to ,software,.,[81], The commons contains ,public property, and ,private property,, over which people have certain traditional rights. When commonly held property is transformed into private property this process is called "",enclosure,"" or ""privatization"". A person who has a right in, or over, common land jointly with another or others is called a commoner.,[82],
,There are a number of important aspects that can be used to describe true commons. The first is that the commons cannot be ,commodified, – if they are, they cease to be commons. The second aspect is that unlike private property, the commons are inclusive rather than exclusive – their nature is to share ownership as widely, rather than as narrowly, as possible. The third aspect is that the assets in commons are meant to be preserved regardless of their ,return of capital,. Just as we receive them as a shared right, so we have a duty to pass them on to future generations in at least the same condition as we received them. If we can add to their value, so much the better, but at a minimum we must not degrade them, and we certainly have no right to destroy them.,[83],
,
,New intellectual commons: free content,[,edit,],
,Main article: ,Free content,
,Free content, or free information, is any kind of functional work, ,artwork,, or other creative ,content, that meets the definition of a ,free cultural work,.,[84], A free cultural work is one which has no significant ,legal, restriction on people's freedom:
,
,To use the content and benefit from using it,,
,To study the content and apply what is learned,,
,To make and distribute copies of the content,,
,To change and improve the content and distribute these derivative works.,[85],[86],
,Although different definitions are used, free content is legally similar if not identical to ,open content,. An analogy is the use of the rival terms ,free software and open source, which describe ideological differences rather than legal ones.,[87], Free content encompasses all works in the ,public domain, and also those ,copyrighted, works whose ,licenses, honor and uphold the freedoms mentioned above. Because copyright law in most countries by default grants copyright holders ,monopolistic control, over their creations, copyright content must be explicitly declared free, usually by the referencing or inclusion of licensing statements from within the work.
,Although a work which is in the public domain because its copyright has expired is considered free, it can become non-free again if the copyright law changes.,[88],
,Information is particularly suited to gift economies, as information is a ,nonrival good, and can be gifted at practically no cost (zero ,marginal cost,).,[89],[90], In fact, there is often an advantage to using the same software or data formats as others, so even from a selfish perspective, it can be advantageous to give away one's information.
,
,Filesharing,[,edit,],
,Markus Giesler,, in his ,ethnography, ,Consumer Gift System,, described music downloading as a system of social solidarity based on gift transactions.,[91], As ,Internet, access spread, file sharing became extremely popular among users who could contribute and receive files on line. This form of gift economy was a model for online services such as ,Napster,, which focused on music sharing and was later sued for ,copyright infringement,. Nonetheless, online file sharing persists in various forms such as ,BitTorrent, and ,direct download link,. A number of communications and intellectual property experts such as ,Henry Jenkins, and ,Lawrence Lessig, have described file-sharing as a form of gift exchange which provides many benefits to artists and consumers alike. They have argued that file sharing fosters community among distributors and allows for a more equitable distribution of media.
,
,Free and open-source software,[,edit,],
,In his essay "",Homesteading the Noosphere,"", noted computer programmer ,Eric S. Raymond, said that ,free and open-source software, developers have created ""a 'gift culture' in which participants compete for prestige by giving time, energy, and creativity away"".,[92], Prestige gained as a result of contributions to source code fosters a social network for the developer; the ,open source community, will recognize the developer's accomplishments and intelligence. Consequently, the developer may find more opportunities to work with other developers. However, prestige is not the only motivator for the giving of lines of code. An anthropological study of the ,Fedora, community, as part of a ,master's, study at the University of North Texas in 2010–11, found that common reasons given by contributors were ""learning for the joy of learning and collaborating with interesting and smart people"". Motivation for personal gain, such as career benefits, was more rarely reported. Many of those surveyed said things like, ""Mainly I contribute just to make it work for me"", and ""programmers develop software to 'scratch an itch,',"".,[93], The International Institute of Infonomics at the University of Maastricht in the Netherlands reported in 2002 that in addition to the above, large corporations, and they specifically mentioned ,IBM,, also spend large annual sums employing developers specifically for them to contribute to open source projects. The firms' and the employees' motivations in such cases are less clear.,[94],
,Members of the ,Linux, community often speak of their community as a gift economy.,[95], The IT research firm IDC valued the Linux kernel at US$18 billion in 2007 and projected its value at US$40 billion in 2010.,[96], The ,Debian, ,distribution, of the ,GNU,/Linux operating system offers over 37,000 free open-source software packages via their AMD64 repositories alone.,[97],
,
,Collaborative works,[,edit,],
,Collaborative works are works created by an open community. For example, ,Wikipedia, – a free online encyclopedia – features millions of articles developed collaboratively, and almost none of its many authors and editors receive any direct material reward.,[98],[99],

,The concept of a gift economy has played a large role in works of fiction about alternative societies, especially in works of ,science fiction,. Examples include:
,
,
,News from Nowhere, (1890) by ,William Morris, is a utopian novel about a society which operates on a gift economy.,
,The Great Explosion, (1962) by ,Eric Frank Russell, describes the encounter of a military survey ship and a ,Gandhian, pacifist society that operates as a gift economy.,
,The Dispossessed, (1974) by ,Ursula K. Le Guin, is a novel about a gift economy society that had exiled themselves from their (,capitalist,) home planet.,
,The ,Mars trilogy,, a series of books written by ,Kim Stanley Robinson, in the 1990s, suggests that new human societies that develop away from ,Earth, could migrate toward a gift economy.,
,The movie ,Pay It Forward, (2000) centers on a schoolboy who, for a school project, comes up with the idea of doing a good deed for another and then asking the recipient to ""pay it forward"". Although the phrase ""gift economy"" is never explicitly mentioned, the scheme would, in effect, create one.,
,Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom, (2003) by ,Cory Doctorow, describes future society where rejuvenation and body-enhancement have made death obsolete, and material goods are no longer scarce, resulting in a ,reputation,-based (,whuffie,) economic system.,
,Wizard's Holiday, (2003) by ,Diane Duane, describes two young wizards visiting a utopian-like planet whose economy is based on gift-giving and mutual support.,
,Voyage from Yesteryear, (1982) by ,James P. Hogan, describes a society of the ,embryo colonists, of ,Alpha Centauri, who have a post-scarcity gift economy.,
,Cradle of Saturn, (1999) and its sequel ,The Anguished Dawn, (2003) by James P. Hogan describe a colonization effort on ,Saturn,'s largest satellite. Both describe the challenges involved in adopting a new economic paradigm.,
,Science fiction, author ,Bruce Sterling, wrote a story, ,Maneki-neko,, in which the cat-paw gesture is the sign of a secret AI-based gift economy.,

,The ,National Football League, (,NFL,) is a professional ,American football, ,league, that consists of 32 teams, divided equally between the ,American Football Conference, (AFC) and the ,National Football Conference, (NFC). The NFL is one of the ,major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada, and the highest ,professional level, of American football in the world.,[5], Each NFL season begins annually with a ,three-week preseason, in August, followed by the ,18-week regular season, which runs from early September to early January, with each team playing 17 games and having one ,bye week,. Following the conclusion of the regular season, seven teams from each conference (four division winners and three ,wild card, teams) advance to the ,playoffs,, a ,single-elimination tournament, that culminates in the ,Super Bowl,, which is contested in February and is played between the winners of the ,AFC, and ,NFC, championship games.
,The NFL was formed in 1920 as the ,American Professional Football Association, (,APFA,) before renaming itself the National Football League for the ,1922 season,. After initially determining champions through end-of-season standings, a playoff system was implemented in 1933 that culminated with the ,NFL Championship Game, until 1966. Following an ,agreement to merge, the NFL with the rival ,American Football League, (AFL), the Super Bowl was first held in 1967 to determine a champion between the best teams from the two leagues and has remained as the final game of each NFL season since the merger was completed in 1970.,[6], The NFL is the wealthiest professional sports league in the world by ,revenue,[7], and the sports league with the most valuable teams.,[8], The NFL also has the highest average ,attendance, (67,591) of any professional sports league in the world,[9], and is the most popular sports league in the United States.,[10], The Super Bowl is also among the biggest club sporting events in the world,,[11], with the individual games accounting for many of the most watched television programs in American history and all occupying the Nielsen's top 5 tally of the all-time most watched U.S. television broadcasts by 2015.,[12], The NFL is headquartered in ,Midtown Manhattan,.
,The ,Green Bay Packers, hold the most combined NFL championships with thirteen, winning nine titles before the Super Bowl era and four Super Bowls afterwards. Since the creation of the Super Bowl, the ,New England Patriots, and ,Pittsburgh Steelers, are tied for the most Super Bowl victories at six each. The reigning league champions are the ,Kansas City Chiefs,, who defeated the ,San Francisco 49ers, by a score of 25–22 in ,Super Bowl LVIII,.

,Founding and history,
,""American Professional Football Association"" redirects here. For the similarly-named minor professional league of the 1930s, see ,Midwest Football League (1935–1940),.,
,On August 20, 1920, a meeting was held by representatives of the ,Akron Pros,, ,Canton Bulldogs,, ,Cleveland Indians,, and ,Dayton Triangles, at the ,Jordan, and ,Hupmobile, auto showroom in ,Canton, Ohio,.,[13], This meeting resulted in the formation of the American Professional Football Conference (APFC), a group who, according to the ,Canton Evening Repository,, intended to ""raise the standard of professional football in every way possible, to eliminate bidding for players between rival clubs and to secure cooperation in the formation of schedules"".,[14],
,A second meeting was held on September 17, 1920, with representatives from teams within four states: Akron, Canton, Cleveland, and Dayton from Ohio; the ,Hammond Pros, and ,Muncie Flyers, from Indiana; the ,Rochester Jeffersons, from New York; and the ,Rock Island Independents,, ,Decatur Staleys,, and ,Racine (Chicago) Cardinals, from Illinois.,[15],[16], The league was renamed to the ,American Professional Football Association (APFA),.,[14], The league elected ,Jim Thorpe, as its first president, and consisted of 14 teams (the ,Buffalo All-Americans,, ,Chicago Tigers,, ,Columbus Panhandles, and ,Detroit Heralds, joined the league during the year). The ,Massillon Tigers, from ,Massillon, Ohio, was also at the September 17 meeting, but did not field a team in 1920. Only two of these teams, the Decatur Staleys (now the Chicago Bears) and the ,Chicago Cardinals, (now the Arizona Cardinals), remain in the NFL.,[17],
,
,The ,Akron Pros, won the first APFA (NFL) Championship in 1920.,
,Although the league did not maintain official standings for its ,1920 inaugural season, and teams played schedules that included non-league opponents, the APFA awarded the Akron Pros the championship by virtue of their ,8–0–3, record.,[18], The first event occurred on September 26, 1920, when the ,Rock Island Independents, defeated the non-league St. Paul Ideals 48–0 at ,Douglas Park,.,[13],[19], On October 3, 1920, the first full week of league play occurred.,[20],[21],
The following season resulted in the Chicago Staleys ,controversially winning the title, over the Buffalo All-Americans.,[22], On June 24, 1922, the APFA changed its name to the National Football League (NFL).,[23],[24],
,In ,1932,, the season ended with the Chicago Bears (,6–1–6,) and the ,Portsmouth Spartans, (,6–1–4,) tied for first in the league standings.,[25], At the time, teams were ranked on a single table and the team with the highest ,winning percentage, (not including ties, which were not counted towards the standings) at the end of the season was declared the champion; the only tiebreaker was that in the event of a tie if two teams played twice in a season, the result of the second game determined the title (the source of the 1921 controversy). This method had been used since the league's creation in 1920, but no situation had been encountered where two teams were tied for first. The league quickly determined that a ,playoff game, between Chicago and Portsmouth was needed to decide the league's champion. The teams were originally scheduled to play the playoff game, officially a regular-season game that would count towards the regular season standings, at ,Wrigley Field, in Chicago, but a combination of heavy snow and extreme cold forced the game to be moved indoors to ,Chicago Stadium,, which did not have a regulation-size football field. Playing with altered rules to accommodate the smaller playing field, the Bears won the game 9–0 and thus won the championship. Fan interest in the ,de facto, championship game led the NFL, beginning in ,1933,, to split into ,two divisions, with a championship game to be played between the division champions.,[26], The ,1934 season, also marked the first of twelve seasons in which African Americans were ,absent from the league,. The ,de facto, ban was rescinded in ,1946,, following public pressure and coinciding with the removal of ,a similar ban, in ,Major League Baseball,.,[27],
,The NFL was always the largest professional football league in the United States; it nevertheless faced numerous rival professional leagues through the 1930s and 1940s. Rival leagues included at least three separate ,American Football Leagues, and the ,All-America Football Conference, (AAFC), on top of various regional leagues of varying caliber. Three NFL teams trace their histories to these rival leagues; the ,Los Angeles Rams, who came from a 1936 iteration of the American Football League, and the ,Cleveland Browns, and ,San Francisco 49ers,, both from the AAFC. By the 1950s, the NFL had an effective monopoly on professional football in the United States; its only competition in North America was the professional ,Canadian football, circuit, which formally became the ,Canadian Football League, (CFL) in 1958. With Canadian football being ,a different football code, than the American game, the CFL established a niche market in Canada and still survives as an independent league.
,A new professional league, the fourth ,American Football League, (AFL), began to play in 1960. The upstart AFL began to challenge the established NFL in popularity, gaining lucrative television contracts and engaging in a bidding war with the NFL for free agents and draft picks. The two leagues announced a ,merger, on June 8, 1966, to take full effect in 1970. In the meantime, the leagues would hold a common draft and championship game. The game, the ,Super Bowl,, was held four times before the merger, with the NFL winning ,Super Bowl I, and ,Super Bowl II,, and the AFL winning ,Super Bowl III, and ,Super Bowl IV,.,[28], After the league merged, it was reorganized into two conferences: the ,National Football Conference, (NFC), consisting of most of the pre-merger NFL teams, and the ,American Football Conference, (AFC), consisting of all of the AFL teams as well as three pre-merger NFL teams.,[29],
,Today, the NFL is the most popular sports league in North America,[30], – with much of the league's growth and popularity attributable to former Commissioner ,Pete Rozelle,, who led the league from 1960 to 1989. Overall annual attendance increased from 3 million at the beginning of his tenure to 17 million by the end of his tenure, and 400 million global viewers watched 1989's ,Super Bowl XXIII,.,[31], The NFL established ,NFL Properties, in 1963. The league's licensing wing, NFL Properties, earns the league billions of dollars annually; Rozelle's tenure also marked the creation of ,NFL Charities, and a national partnership with ,United Way,.,[31], ,Paul Tagliabue, was elected as commissioner to succeed Rozelle; his 17-year tenure, which ended in 2006, was marked by large increases in television contracts and the addition of four expansion teams,,[32], as well as the introduction of league initiatives to increase the number of minorities in league and team management roles.,[33], The league's current Commissioner, ,Roger Goodell,, has focused on reducing the number of illegal hits and making the sport safer, mainly through fining or suspending players who break rules.,[34], These actions are among many the NFL is taking to reduce ,concussions, and improve player safety.,[35], Prior to 2021, the NFL had utilized race-based adjustments of dementia claims in the $1 billion settlement of concussion claims, which had been criticized by critics before the NFL decided to end what was called ""race-norming"".,[36],[37], On May 21, 2024, the NFL announced the NFL Source initiative, aimed at increasing the number of minority- and women-owned businesses that work with the league throughout the year.,[38], NFL Source will be mandatory for teams that host major events, such as the Super Bowl and the NFL Draft, and their organizing committees, but will be optional for other contracts at the team level.,[39], The NFL will partner with the U.S. Black Chambers, Inc to help local businesses across the country obtain the certifications necessary to do business with the league in furtherance of its efforts to increase partnerships with certified and underrepresented businesses that are 51% owned and operated or led by a veteran, woman, minority, person with disabilities or LGBTQ+.,[40],
,
,Season and playoff development,
,Main article: ,List of National Football League seasons,
,From 1920 to 1934, the NFL did not have a set number of games for teams to play, instead setting a minimum. The league mandated a twelve-game regular season for each team beginning in ,1935,, later shortening this to eleven games in ,1937, and ten games in ,1943,, mainly due to World War II. After the war ended, the number of games returned to eleven games in ,1946,, and later back to twelve in 1947. The NFL went to a 14-game schedule in ,1961,, which it retained until switching to a 16-game schedule in ,1978,.,[41], In March 2021, the NFL officially adopted a 17-game schedule after gaining the agreement of the ,National Football League Players Association, (NFLPA).,[42],
,Having an odd number of games in the schedule will give half the teams nine games as the home team, while half the teams have only eight home games. To minimize the perceived benefit on competition of having more home games, the extra home game will be rotated between the two conferences each year. This is because playoff berths are allocated at the conference level, so all teams within the conference will have played the same number of home games.
,The NFL operated in a two-conference system from 1933 to ,1966,, where the champions of each conference would meet in the ,NFL Championship Game,. If two teams tied for the conference lead, they would meet in a ,one-game playoff, to determine the conference champion. In ,1967,, the NFL expanded from 15 teams to 16 teams. Instead of just evening out the conferences by adding the expansion ,New Orleans Saints, to the seven-member Western Conference, the NFL realigned the conferences and split each into two four-team divisions. The four division champions would meet in the ,NFL playoffs,, a two-round playoff.,[43], The NFL also operated the ,Playoff Bowl, (officially the Bert Bell Benefit Bowl) from 1960 to 1969. Effectively, a ,third-place game,, pitting the two conference runners-up against each other, the league considers Playoff Bowls to have been ,exhibitions, rather than playoff games. The league discontinued the Playoff Bowl in 1970 due to its perception as a game for losers.,[44],
,Following the addition of the former AFL teams into the NFL in ,1970,, the NFL split into two conferences with three divisions each. The expanded league, now with twenty-six teams,,[29], would also feature an expanded eight-team playoff, the participants being the three division champions from each conference as well as one 'wild card' team (the team with the best win percentage that did not win its division) from each conference. In 1978, the league added a second wild card team from each conference, bringing the total number of playoff teams to ten, and a further two wild card teams were added in ,1990, to bring the total to twelve. When the NFL expanded to 32 teams in ,2002,, the league realigned, changing the division structure from three divisions in each conference to four divisions in each conference. As each division champion gets a playoff bid, the number of wild card teams from each conference dropped from three to two.,[45], The playoffs expanded again in 2020, adding two more wild card teams to bring the total to 14 playoff teams.,[46],
,
,Corporate structure,
,See also: ,Commissioner of the NFL,
,Roger Goodell,, ,National Football League Commissioner, since 2006 (pictured in 2012),
,At the corporate level, the National Football League considers itself a ,trade association, made up of and financed by its 32 member teams.,[47], Up until 2015, the league was an unincorporated nonprofit ,501(c)(6), association.,[48], Section 501(c)(6) of the ,Internal Revenue Code, provides an exemption from federal income taxation for ""Business leagues, chambers of commerce, real-estate boards, boards of trade, or professional football leagues (whether or not administering a pension fund for football players), not organized for profit and no part of the net earnings of which inures to the benefit of any private shareholder or individual."",[49], In contrast, each individual team, with the exception of the non-profit ,Green Bay Packers,,,[50], is subject to tax because they make a profit.,[51],
,In 2015, the NFL gave up its tax-exempt status following public criticism; in a letter to the club owners, Commissioner ,Roger Goodell, labeled it a ""distraction"", saying ""the effects of the tax-exempt status of the league office have been mischaracterized repeatedly in recent years… Every dollar of income generated through television rights fees, licensing agreements, sponsorships, ticket sales, and other means is earned by the 32 clubs and is taxable there. This will remain the case even when the league office and Management Council file returns as taxable entities, and the change in filing status will make no material difference to our business."" As a result, the league office might owe around US$10 million in income taxes, but it is no longer required to disclose the salaries of its executive officers.,[52],
,The league has three defined officers: the commissioner, secretary, and treasurer. Each conference has one defined officer, the president, which is essentially an honorary position with few powers and mostly ceremonial duties, including awarding the conference championship trophy.
,The commissioner is elected by the affirmative vote of two-thirds or eighteen (whichever is greater) of the members of the league, while the president of each conference is elected by an affirmative vote of three-fourths or 10 of the conference members.,[53], The commissioner appoints the secretary and treasurer and has broad authority in disputes between clubs, players, coaches, and employees. He is the ""principal ,executive officer,"",[54], of the NFL and also has authority in hiring league employees, negotiating television contracts, disciplining individuals that own part or all of an NFL team, clubs, or employed individuals of an NFL club if they have violated league by-laws or committed ""conduct detrimental to the welfare of the League or professional football"".,[54], The commissioner can, in the event of misconduct by a party associated with the league, suspend individuals, hand down a fine of up to US$500,000, cancel contracts with the league, and award or strip teams of draft picks.,[54],
,In extreme cases, the commissioner can offer recommendations to the NFL's executive committee, up to and including the ""cancellation or forfeiture"",[54], of a club's franchise or any other action, he deems necessary. The commissioner can also issue sanctions up to and including a lifetime ban from the league if an individual connected to the NFL has bet on games or failed to notify the league of conspiracies or plans to bet on or fix games.,[54], The current Commissioner of the National Football League is Roger Goodell, who was elected in 2006 after ,Paul Tagliabue,, the previous commissioner, retired.,[55],

The NFL consists of 32 clubs divided into two conferences of 16 teams each. Each conference is divided into four divisions of four clubs each. During the regular season, each team is allowed a maximum of 55 players on its roster; only 48 of these may be active (eligible to play) on game days.,[56], Each team can also have a sixteen-player ,practice squad, separate from its main roster.,[57],
,Each NFL club is granted a franchise, the league's authorization for the team to operate in its home city. This franchise covers 'Home Territory' (the 75 miles surrounding the city limits, or, if the team is within 100 miles of another league city, half the distance between the two cities) and 'Home Marketing Area' (Home Territory plus the rest of the state the club operates in, as well as the area the team operates its training camp in for the duration of the camp). Each NFL member has the exclusive right to host professional football games inside its Home Territory and the exclusive right to advertise, promote, and host events in its Home Marketing Area. There are a couple of exceptions to this rule, mostly relating to teams with close proximity to each other: teams that operate in the same city (e.g. New York City and Los Angeles) or the same state (e.g. California, Florida, and ,Texas,) share the rights to the city's Home Territory and the state's Home Marketing Area, respectively.,[58],
,According to ,Forbes,, the ,Dallas Cowboys,, at approximately US$8 billion, are the most valuable NFL franchise and the most valuable sports team in the world.,[59], 26 of the 32 NFL teams rank among the Top 50 most valuable sports teams in the world;,[8], and 16 of the NFL's owners are listed on the ,Forbes 400,, the most of any sports league or organization.,[60],

,Season format,
,Main article: ,List of NFL seasons,
,The NFL season format consists of a three-week ,preseason,, an 18-week ,regular season, (each team plays 17 games), and a 14-team ,single-elimination playoff, culminating in the Super Bowl, the league's championship game.
,
,Preseason,
,Main article: ,NFL preseason,
,The NFL preseason begins with the ,Pro Football Hall of Fame Game,, played at ,Tom Benson Hall of Fame Stadium, in ,Canton,.,[71], Each NFL team is required to schedule three preseason games. NFC teams must play at least two of these at home in odd numbered years and AFC teams must play at least two at home in even numbered years. However, the teams involved in the Hall of Fame game, as well as any team that played in an ,American Bowl, game, play four preseason games.,[72], Preseason games are ,exhibition matches, and do not count towards regular-season totals.,[73], Because the preseason does not count towards standings, teams generally do not focus on winning games; instead, they are used by coaches to evaluate their teams and by players to show their performance, both to their current team and to other teams if they get cut.,[74], The quality of preseason games has been criticized by some fans, who dislike having to pay full price for exhibition games,,[75], as well as by some players and coaches, who dislike the risk of injury the games have, while others have felt the preseason is a necessary part of the NFL season.,[74],[75],

This chart of the ,2021 season standings, displays an application of the NFL scheduling formula. The ,Rams in 2021, (highlighted in green) finished in first place in the ,NFC West,. Thus, ,in 2022,, the Rams played two games against each of its division rivals (highlighted in light blue), one game against each team in the ,NFC South, and ,AFC West, (highlighted in yellow), one game each against the first-place finishers in the ,NFC East, and ,NFC North, (highlighted in orange) and one game against the team who finished first in the AFC East (highlighted in pink).,
,Currently, the 14 opponents each team faces over the 17-game regular season schedule are set using a pre-determined formula:,[76], The league runs an 18-week, 272-game regular season. Since 2021, the season has begun the week after Labor Day (the first Monday in September) and concluded the week after New Year.,[77], The opening game of the season is normally a home game on a Thursday for the league's defending champion.,[78],
,Most NFL games are played on Sundays, with a ,Monday night game, typically held at least once a week and ,Thursday night games, occurring on most weeks as well.,[78], NFL games are not normally played on Fridays or Saturdays until late in the regular season, as ,federal law, prohibits professional football leagues from competing with college or high school football. Because high school and college teams typically play games on Friday and Saturday, respectively, the NFL cannot hold games on those days until the Friday before the third Saturday in December. While Saturday games late in the season are common, the league rarely holds Friday games, the most recent one being on Christmas Day in 2020.,[79], NFL games are rarely scheduled for Tuesday or Wednesday, and those days have only been used three times since 1948: in 2010, when a Sunday game was rescheduled to Tuesday due to a blizzard; in 2012, when the ,Kickoff game, was moved from Thursday to Wednesday to avoid conflict with the ,Democratic National Convention,;,[80],[81], and in 2020, when a game was postponed from Sunday to Tuesday due to players ,testing positive, for ,COVID-19,.
,NFL regular season matchups are determined according to a scheduling formula. Within a division, all four teams play 14 out of their 17 games against common opponents or each other– two games (home and away) are played against the other three teams in the division, while one game is held against all the members of a division from the NFC and a division from the AFC as determined by a rotating cycle (three years for the conference the team is in, and four years in the conference they are not in). Two of the other games are intraconference games, determined by the standings of the previous year – for example, if a team finishes first in its division, it will play two other first-place teams in its conference, while a team that finishes last would play two other last-place teams in the conference. The final game is an inter-conference based on a rotating cycle and determined by previous season's standings.,[82], In total, each team plays 17 games and has one bye week, where it does not play a game.,[83],
,Although a team's home and away opponents are known by the end of the previous year's regular season, the exact dates and times for NFL games are not determined until much later because the league has to account for, among other things, the ,Major League Baseball postseason, and local events that could pose a scheduling conflict with NFL games. During the 2010 season, over 500,000 potential schedules were created by computers, 5,000 of which were considered ""playable schedules"" and were reviewed by the NFL's scheduling team. After arriving at what they felt was the best schedule out of the group, nearly 50 more potential schedules were developed to try to ensure that the chosen schedule would be the best possible one.,[84],

,Main articles: ,NFL playoffs,, ,Pro Bowl,, and ,Super Bowl,
,Following the conclusion of the regular season, the NFL Playoffs, a 14-team single-elimination tournament, is then held. Seven teams are selected from each conference: the winners of each of the four divisions as well as three wild card teams (the three remaining teams with the best overall record, with tiebreakers in the event of two or more teams having the same record). These teams are seeded according to overall record and tiebreakers, with the division champions always ranking higher than the wild card teams.,[85], The top team (seeded one) from each conference are awarded a bye week, while the remaining six teams (seeded 2–7) from each conference compete in the first round of the playoffs, the Wild Card round, with the 2-seed competing against the 7-seed, the 3-seed competing against the 6-seed and the 4-seed competing against the 5-seed. The winners of the Wild Card round advance to the Divisional Round, which matches the lower seeded team against the 1-seed and the two remaining teams against each other. The winners of those games then compete in the Conference Championships, with the higher remaining seed hosting the lower remaining seed. The AFC and NFC champions then compete in the Super Bowl to determine the league champion.
,The only other postseason event hosted by the NFL is the ,Pro Bowl,, the league's ,all-star game,. Since 2009, the Pro Bowl has been held the week before the ,Super Bowl,; in previous years, the game was held the week following the Super Bowl, but in an effort to boost ratings, the game was moved to the week before.,[86], Because of this, players from the teams participating in the Super Bowl are exempt from participating in the game. The Pro Bowl is not considered as competitive as a regular-season game because the biggest concern of teams is to avoid injuries to the players.,[87],

,Trophies and awards,
,Main article: ,List of NFL awards,
,Team trophies,
,Main articles: ,Vince Lombardi Trophy,, ,Ed Thorp Memorial Trophy,, and ,Brunswick-Balke Collender Cup,
,The National Football League has used three different trophies to honor its champion over its existence. The first trophy, the ,Brunswick-Balke Collender Cup,, was donated to the NFL (then APFA) in 1920 by the ,Brunswick-Balke Collender Corporation,. The trophy, the appearance of which is only known by its description as a ""silver loving cup"", was intended to be a traveling trophy and not to become permanent until a team had won at least three titles. The league awarded it to the Akron Pros, champions of the inaugural 1920 season; however, the trophy was discontinued and its current whereabouts are unknown.,[88],
,A second trophy, the ,Ed Thorp Memorial Trophy,, was issued by the NFL from 1934 to 1967. The trophy's namesake, Ed Thorp, was a referee in the league and a friend to many early league owners; upon his death in 1934, the league created the trophy to honor him. In addition to the main trophy, which would be in the possession of the current league champion, the league issued a smaller replica trophy to each champion, who would maintain permanent control over it. The current location of the Ed Thorp Memorial Trophy, long thought to be lost,,[89], is believed to be possessed by the ,Green Bay Packers Hall of Fame,.,[90],
,The current trophy of the NFL is the ,Vince Lombardi Trophy,. The Super Bowl trophy was officially renamed in 1970 after ,Vince Lombardi,, who as head coach led the Green Bay Packers to victories in the first two Super Bowls. Unlike the previous trophies, a new Vince Lombardi Trophy is issued to each year's champion, who maintains permanent control of it. Lombardi Trophies are made by ,Tiffany & Co., out of sterling silver and are worth anywhere from US$25,000 to US$300,000.,[91], Additionally, each player on the winning team as well as coaches and personnel are awarded ,Super Bowl rings, to commemorate their victory. The winning team chooses the company that makes the rings; each ring design varies, with the NFL mandating certain ring specifications (which have a degree of room for deviation), in addition to requiring the Super Bowl logo be on at least one side of the ring.,[92], The losing team are also awarded rings, which must be no more than half as valuable as the winners' rings, but those are almost never worn.,[93],
,The conference champions receive trophies for their achievement. The champions of the NFC receive the ,George Halas Trophy,,,[94], named after Chicago Bears founder ,George Halas,, who is also considered one of the co-founders of the NFL. The AFC champions receive the ,Lamar Hunt Trophy,,,[95], named after ,Lamar Hunt,, the founder of the Kansas City Chiefs and the principal founder of the American Football League. Players on the winning team also receive a conference championship ring.,[96],[97],

,Player and coach awards,
,See also: ,Category:National Football League trophies and awards,
,The NFL recognizes a number of awards for its players and coaches at its annual ,NFL Honors, presentation. The most prestigious award is the ,AP Most Valuable Player, (MVP) award.,[98], Other major awards include the ,AP Offensive Player of the Year,, ,AP Defensive Player of the Year,, ,AP Comeback Player of the Year,, and the ,AP Offensive and Defensive Rookie of the Year, awards.,[99], Another prestigious award is the ,Walter Payton Man of the Year Award,, which recognizes a player's off-field work in addition to his on-field performance.,[100], The ,NFL Coach of the Year, award is the highest coaching award.,[101], The NFL also gives out weekly awards such as the ,FedEx Air & Ground NFL Players of the Week,[102], and the ,Pepsi MAX NFL Rookie of the Week, awards.,[103],
,
,Media coverage,
,Main article: ,NFL on American television,
,See also: ,List of current NFL broadcasters,
,In the United States, the National Football League is televised on eight networks across seven media partners: ,ESPN,/,ABC,, ,CBS,, ,Fox,, ,NBC,, ,Prime Video,, ,Netflix,, and ,NFL Network,. The league offers its media rights in packages of games to prospective media partners. The packages can vary depending on conference, broadcast time slot, or both. CBS televises afternoon games from the AFC package, and Fox carries afternoon games from the NFC package. These afternoon games are not carried on all affiliates, as multiple games are being played at once; each network affiliate is assigned one game per time slot, according to a complicated set of rules.,[104], Since 2011, the league has reserved the right to give Sunday games that, under the contract, would normally air on one network to the other network (known as ""flexible scheduling"").,[105], The only way to legally watch a regionally televised game not being carried on the local network affiliates is to purchase NFL Sunday Ticket, the league's ,out-of-market sports package,, which is available through ,YouTube TV, starting with the 2023 season.,[106], The league also provides ,NFL RedZone,, an ,omnibus telecast, that cuts to the most relevant plays in each game, live as they happen.
,In addition to the regional games, the league also has packages of telecasts, mostly in prime time, that are carried nationwide. NBC broadcasts the primetime ,Sunday Night Football, package, which includes the Thursday ,NFL Kickoff game, that starts the regular season and a primetime ,Thanksgiving Day game,. ESPN is the main broadcaster of the ,Monday Night Football, package with ABC airing select games either exclusively or as a simulcast with ESPN. ,Amazon,, through their Prime Video streaming service, is the exclusive carrier of the ,Thursday Night Football, package. NFL Network, a U.S. pay cable channel owned by the league itself, broadcasts select games under the ,NFL Network Exclusive Game Series, banner. Games under this banner usually consist of ,NFL International Series, games and select Saturday games. In 2023, the NFL occupied the top three rates for a 30-second advertisement: $882,079 for ,Sunday Night Football,, $562,524 for ,Monday Night Football,, and $440,523 for ,Thursday Night Football,.,[107],
,The league, in recent years, has expanded their televised broadcasts to ,over-the-top, streaming services. Since 2022, Amazon holds the exclusive rights to broadcast the ,Thursday Night Football, package.,[108], Prior to then, Amazon streamed games from the same package as part of a tri-cast model that saw games aired on broadcast television (initially through CBS and NBC, then later with Fox), cable television (through NFL Network), and digital streaming (through Prime Video).,[109],[110],[111], Amazon has also streamed games for free on ,Twitch, since 2018.,[111], CBS streams its AFC package games on ,Paramount+, as a simulcast with its CBS broadcasts.,[112],[113], NBC streams ,Sunday Night Football, and select exclusive games on ,Peacock,.,[112],[114],[115], ESPN streams its games on ,ESPN+, in simulcast with the broadcasts on ESPN and/or ABC.,[112],[116], ESPN also holds exclusive rights to stream one Sunday morning international game on ESPN+.,[116], Beginning in 2024, Netflix holds the global streaming rights for at least one Christmas Day game every season as part of a three-year deal.,[117],
,The Super Bowl television rights are rotated on a four-year basis between CBS, Fox, NBC, and ESPN/ABC. The NFL's most recent contract negotiation for the media rights deal was announced on March 18, 2021, to take effect beginning in the 2023 season. The deal renewed previous rights agreements made by the NFL and each of its network partners to air their respective game packages, while awarding Amazon the ,Thursday Night Football, package. ESPN/ABC is set to return to the Super Bowl broadcast rotation and will broadcast the Super Bowl on U.S. television in 2027, 21 years after airing its last Super Bowl, ,Super Bowl XL,. Digital and streaming distribution was expanded to allow CBS, NBC, and ESPN/ABC to stream games on their respective over-the-top streaming services. For each of the packages the respective network partners currently hold, ESPN/ABC is paying US$2.7 billion a year; CBS, Fox, and NBC are each paying more than US$2 billion a year; and Amazon is paying US$1 billion a year. The current deal runs through the 2033 season.,[112],[118],[119],
,The league also has deals with Spanish-language broadcasters ,NBC Universo,, ,Fox Deportes,, and ,ESPN Deportes,, which air Spanish language dubs of their respective English-language sister networks' games.,[120],[121], The league's contracts do not cover preseason games, which individual teams are free to sell to local stations directly; a minority of preseason games are distributed among the league's national television partners.
,Through the 2014 season, the NFL had a ,blackout policy, in which games were 'blacked out' on local television in the home team's area if the home stadium was not sold out. Clubs could elect to set this requirement at only 85%, but they would have to give more ticket revenue to the visiting team; teams could also request a specific exemption from the NFL for the game. The vast majority of NFL games were not blacked out; only 6% of games were blacked out during the ,2011 season,,,[122], and only two games were blacked out in ,2013, and none in ,2014,.,[123], The NFL announced in March 2015 that it would suspend its blackout policy for at least the ,2015 season,.,[123], According to ,Nielsen,, the NFL regular season since 2012 was watched by at least 200 million individuals, accounting for 80% of all television households in the United States and 69% of all potential viewers in the United States. NFL regular season games accounted for 31 out of the top 32 most-watched programs in the fall season and an NFL game ranked as the most-watched television show in all 17 weeks of the regular season. At the local level, NFL games were the highest-ranked shows in NFL markets 92% of the time.,[124], Super Bowls account for the 22 most-watched programs (based on total audience) in US history, including a record 167 million people that watched ,Super Bowl XLVIII,, the conclusion to the 2013 season.,[125],
,In addition to radio networks run by each NFL team, select NFL games are broadcast nationally by ,Westwood One, (known as Dial Global for the 2012 season). These games are broadcast on over 500 networks, giving all NFL markets access to each primetime game. The NFL's deal with Westwood One was extended in 2012 and continued through 2017.,[126], Other NFL games are nationally distributed by ,Compass Media Networks, and ,Sports USA Radio Network, under contracts with individual teams.
,Some broadcasting innovations have either been introduced or popularized during NFL telecasts. Among them, the ,Skycam, camera system was used for the first time in a live telecast, at a 1984 preseason NFL game in San Diego between the ,Chargers, and ,49ers,, and televised by CBS.,[127], Commentator ,John Madden, famously used a ,telestrator, during games between the early 1980s to the mid-2000s, boosting the device's popularity.,[128],
,
,Draft,
,Main article: ,NFL draft,
,Chicago Bears, quarterback ,Caleb Williams,, the first overall pick of the ,2024 NFL draft,
,Each April (excluding 2014 when it took place in May), the NFL holds a draft of college players. The draft consists of seven rounds, with each of the 32 clubs getting one pick in each round.,[129], The draft order for non-playoff teams is determined by regular-season record; among playoff teams, teams are first ranked by the furthest round of the playoffs they reached, and then are ranked by regular-season record. For example, any team that reached the divisional round will be given a higher pick than any team that reached the conference championships, but will be given a lower pick than any team that did not make the divisional round. The Super Bowl champion always drafts last, and the losing team from the Super Bowl always drafts next-to-last.,[130], All potential draftees must be at least three years removed from high school in order to be eligible for the draft.,[131], ,Underclassmen, that have met that criterion to be eligible for the draft must write an application to the NFL by January 15 renouncing their remaining college eligibility.,[132], Clubs can trade away picks for future draft picks, but cannot trade the rights to players they have selected in previous drafts.,[133],
,Aside from the seven picks each club gets, compensatory draft picks are given to teams that have lost more compensatory free agents than they have gained. These are spread out from rounds 3 to 7, and a total of 32 are given.,[134], Clubs are required to make their selection within a certain period of time, the exact time depending on which round the pick is made in. If they fail to do so on time, the clubs behind them can begin to select their players in order, but they do not lose the pick outright. This happened in the ,2003 draft,, when the Minnesota Vikings failed to make their selection on time. The Jacksonville Jaguars and ,Carolina Panthers, were able to make their picks before the Vikings were able to use theirs.,[135], Selected players are only allowed to negotiate contracts with the team that picked them, but if they choose not to sign they become eligible for the next year's draft.,[136], Under the current collective bargaining contract, all contracts to drafted players must be four-year deals with a club option for a fifth. Contracts themselves are limited to a certain amount of money, depending on the exact draft pick the player was selected with.,[137], Players who were draft eligible but not picked in the draft are free to sign with any club.,[129],
,The NFL operates several other drafts in addition to the NFL draft. The league holds a ,supplemental draft, annually. Clubs submit emails to the league stating the player they wish to select and the round they will do so, and the team with the highest bid wins the rights to that player. The exact order is determined by a lottery held before the draft, and a successful bid for a player will result in the team forfeiting the rights to its pick in the equivalent round of the next NFL draft.,[138], Players are only eligible for the supplemental draft after being granted a petition for special eligibility.,[139], The league holds ,expansion drafts,, the most recent happening in ,2002, when the ,Houston Texans, began play as an ,expansion team,.,[140], Other drafts held by the league include ,an allocation draft in 1950, to allocate players from several teams that played in the dissolved All-America Football Conference,[141], and a ,supplemental draft in 1984, to give NFL teams the rights to players who had been eligible for the main draft but had not been drafted because they had signed contracts with the ,United States Football League, or ,Canadian Football League,.,[142],
,Like the other ,major sports leagues in the United States,, the NFL maintains protocol for a ,disaster draft,. In the event of a 'near disaster' (less than 15 players killed or disabled) that caused the club to lose a quarterback, they could draft one from a team with at least three quarterbacks. In the event of a 'disaster' (15 or more players killed or disabled) that results in a club's season being canceled, a restocking draft would be held. Neither of these protocols has ever had to be implemented.,[143],
,
,Free agency,
,Free agents, in the National Football League are divided into ,restricted free agents,, who have three accrued seasons and whose current contract has expired, and ,unrestricted free agents,, who have four or more accrued seasons and whose contract has expired. An accrued season is defined as ""six or more regular-season games on a club's active/inactive, reserved/injured or reserve/physically unable to perform lists"".,[144], Restricted free agents are allowed to negotiate with other clubs besides their former club, but the former club has the right to match any offer. If they choose not to, they are compensated with draft picks. Unrestricted free agents are free to sign with any club, and no compensation is owed if they sign with a different club.,[144],
,Clubs are given one ,franchise tag, to offer to any unrestricted free agent. The franchise tag is a one-year deal that pays the player 120% of his previous contract or no less than the average of the five highest-paid players at his position, whichever is greater. There are two types of franchise tags: exclusive tags, which do not allow the player to negotiate with other clubs, and non-exclusive tags, which allow the player to negotiate with other clubs but gives his former club the right to match any offer and two first-round draft picks if they decline to match it.,[145],
,Clubs also have the option to use a ,transition tag,, which is similar to the non-exclusive franchise tag but offers no compensation if the former club refuses to match the offer.,[146], Due to that stipulation, the transition tag is rarely used,,[147], even with the removal of the ""poison pill"" strategy (offering a contract with stipulations that the former club would be unable to match) that essentially ended the usage of the tag league-wide.,[148], Each club is subject to a ,salary cap,, which is set at US$188.2 million for the 2019 season,,[149], US$11 million more than that of 2018.,[149],
,Members of clubs' ,practice squads,, despite being paid by and working for their respective clubs, are also simultaneously a kind of free agent and are able to sign to any other club's active roster (provided their new club is not their previous club's next opponent within a set number of days) without compensation to their previous club; practice squad players cannot be signed to other clubs' practice squads, however, unless released by their original club first.,[150],

,Die ,englische Sprache, (Eigenbezeichnung: ,English,ⓘ,/,?, [,.mw-parser-output .IPA a{text-decoration:none},ˈɪŋɡlɪʃ,]) ist eine ursprünglich in ,England, beheimatete ,germanische Sprache,, die zum ,westgermanischen Zweig, gehört. Sie entwickelte sich ab dem frühen Mittelalter durch Einwanderung ,nordseegermanischer, Völker nach Britannien, darunter der ,Angeln, – von denen sich das Wort ,Englisch, herleitet – sowie der ,Sachsen,. Die Frühformen der Sprache werden daher auch manchmal ,Angelsächsisch, genannt.
,
,
,Die am nächsten verwandten lebenden Sprachen sind die ,friesischen Sprachen, und das ,Niederdeutsche, auf dem Festland. Im Verlauf seiner Geschichte hat das Englische allerdings starke Sonderentwicklungen ausgebildet: Im ,Satzbau, wechselte das Englische im Gegensatz zu allen westgermanischen Verwandten auf dem Kontinent in ein ,Subjekt-Verb-Objekt,-Schema über und verlor die ,Verbzweiteigenschaft,. Die Bildung von Wortformen (,Flexion,) bei Substantiven, Artikeln, Verben und Adjektiven wurde stark abgebaut. Im Wortschatz wurde das Englische in einer frühen Phase zunächst vom ,Sprachkontakt, mit ,nordgermanischen Sprachen, beeinflusst, der sich durch die zeitweilige ,Besetzung durch Dänen und Norweger, im 9. Jahrhundert ergab. Später ergab sich nochmals eine starke Prägung durch den Kontakt mit dem ,Französischen, aufgrund der ,normannischen Eroberung Englands, ,1066,. Aufgrund der vielfältigen Einflüsse aus westgermanischen und nordgermanischen Sprachen, dem Französischen sowie den ,klassischen Sprachen, besitzt das ,heutige Englisch, einen außergewöhnlich umfangreichen Wortschatz.
,Die englische Sprache wird mit dem ,lateinischen Alphabet, geschrieben. Eine wesentliche Fixierung der Rechtschreibung erfolgte mit Aufkommen des ,Buchdrucks, im 15./16. Jahrhundert, trotz gleichzeitig fortlaufenden ,Lautwandels,.,[4], Die heutige Schreibung des Englischen stellt daher eine stark ,historische Orthographie, dar, die von der Abbildung der tatsächlichen Lautgestalt vielfältig abweicht.
,Ausgehend von seinem Entstehungsort England breitete sich das Englische über die gesamten ,Britischen Inseln, aus und verdrängte allmählich die zuvor dort gesprochenen, v. a. ,keltischen, Sprachen, die aber als kleinere Sprechergemeinschaften inmitten des englischen Sprachraums bis heute fortbestehen. In seiner weiteren Geschichte ist das Englische vor allem infolge des historischen ,Kolonialismus, ,Großbritanniens, in Amerika, Australien, Afrika und Indien zu einer ,Weltsprache, geworden, die heute (global) weiter verbreitet ist als jede andere Sprache (,Liste der meistgesprochenen Sprachen,). Englischsprachige Länder und Gebiete ,(meist ehemalige britische Kolonien und Besitzungen), bzw. ihre Bewohner werden auch ,anglophon, genannt.
,Englisch wird in den ,Schulen, vieler Länder als erste ,Fremdsprache, gelehrt und ist offizielle Sprache der meisten ,internationalen Organisationen,, wobei viele davon daneben noch andere offizielle Sprachen nutzen. In Westdeutschland verständigten sich die ,Länder, 1955 im ,Düsseldorfer Abkommen, darauf, an den Schulen Englisch generell als Pflichtfremdsprache einzuführen.

,Die englischsprachige Welt,[,Bearbeiten, | ,Quelltext bearbeiten,],
,Im April 2017 sprachen weltweit etwa 340 Millionen Menschen Englisch als ,Muttersprache,.,[1], Die Schätzungen zur Zahl der ,Zweitsprachler, schwanken je nach Quelle massiv, da unterschiedliche Grade des Sprachverständnisses herangezogen werden. Hier finden sich Zahlen von unter 200 Millionen,[2], bis zwei Milliarden Menschen.,[5], Der ,Ethnologue, 2023 gibt etwa 370 Millionen Muttersprachler und 1,46 Milliarden Sprecher weltweit an.,[6],[7],

,Auch die Einführung von Englisch als ,Verwaltungs-, und anschließend als Amtssprache in den Teilstaaten der Europäischen Union wird besprochen. Einer repräsentativen ,YouGov,-Umfrage von 2013 zufolge würden es 59 Prozent der Deutschen begrüßen, wenn die englische Sprache in der gesamten Europäischen Union den Stand einer Amtssprache erlangen würde (zusätzlich zu den bisherigen Sprachen), in anderen Ländern Europas liegen die Zustimmungsraten teilweise bei über 60 Prozent.,[11],

,
,Sprachwissenschaftliche Einordnung,[,Bearbeiten, | ,Quelltext bearbeiten,],
,Das Englische gehört zu den ,indogermanischen Sprachen,, die ursprünglich sehr stark ,flektierende, Merkmale aufwiesen. Alle indogermanischen Sprachen weisen diese Charakteristik bis heute mehr oder weniger auf. Allerdings besteht in allen diesen Sprachen eine mehr oder weniger starke Neigung von ,flektierenden, zu ,isolierenden Formen,. Im Englischen war diese Tendenz bislang besonders stark ausgeprägt. Heute trägt die englische Sprache überwiegend isolierende Züge und ähnelt strukturell teilweise eher isolierenden Sprachen wie dem ,Chinesischen, als den ,genetisch, eng verwandten Sprachen wie dem Deutschen.
,Zudem hat sich die englische Sprache heute durch die globale Verbreitung in viele Varianten aufgeteilt. Viele europäische Sprachen bilden auch völlig neue Begriffe auf Basis der englischen Sprache (,Anglizismen,, ,Scheinanglizismen,). Auch in einigen ,Fachsprachen, werden die ,Termini, von Anglizismen geprägt, vor allem in stark ,globalisierten, Bereichen wie z. B. ,Informatik, oder ,Wirtschaft,.
,Der Sprachcode ist ,en, oder ,eng, (nach ,ISO 639-1 bzw. 2,). Der Code für ,Altenglisch, bzw. Angelsächsisch (etwa die Jahre 450 bis 1100 n. Chr.) ist ,ang,, jener für ,Mittelenglisch, (etwa 1100 bis 1500) ,enm,.

,Varietäten der englischen Sprache,[,Bearbeiten, | ,Quelltext bearbeiten,],
,Durch die weltweite Verbreitung der englischen Sprache hat diese zahlreiche Varietäten entwickelt oder sich mit anderen Sprachen vermischt.
,Folgende Sprachvarietäten werden unterschieden:
,
,

,
,
,Afroamerikanisches Englisch,
,Amerikanisches Englisch,
,Aukaans,1,, ,Saramaccaans,1, und ,Sranantongo,1, (Suriname-Englisch),
,Australisches Englisch,

,Falkländisches Englisch,
,Hawaiisches Englisch,1,

,Kamtok,1, (Kamerunisches Englisch),
,Kanadisches Englisch,
,Karibisches Englisch,1, (Kreolisches Englisch) ,(siehe daneben auch ,Jamaikanisch-kreolische Sprache,),
,Krio,1, (Sierra Leone-Englisch),

,Südafrikanisches Englisch, ,(siehe daneben auch ,Afrikaans,),
,Tinglish, (Thai-Englisch),
,Tok Pisin,1, (Papua-Neuguinea-Englisch),
,Walisisches Englisch,
,
,Für den raschen Erwerb des Englischen wurden immer wieder vereinfachte Formen konstruiert, so ,Basic English, bzw. Simple English oder Einfaches Englisch (vorgestellt 1930, 850 Wörter), ,Globish, (vorgestellt 1998, 1500 Wörter) und ,Basic Global English, (vorgestellt 2006, 750 Wörter). Daneben hat sich eine Reihe von ,Pidgin-, und ,Kreolsprachen,1, auf englischem Substrat (vor allem in der Karibik, Afrika und ,Ozeanien,) entwickelt.
,
,Anglizismen,[,Bearbeiten, | ,Quelltext bearbeiten,],
,→ ,Hauptartikel,: ,Anglizismus,
,In andere Sprachen eindringende Anglizismen werden manchmal mit abwertenden Namen wie „,Denglisch,“ (Deutsch und Englisch) oder „,Franglais,“ (Französisch und Englisch) belegt. Dabei handelt es sich nicht um Varianten des Englischen, sondern um Erscheinungen in der jeweils betroffenen Sprache. Der scherzhafte Begriff „,Engrish,“ wiederum bezeichnet keine spezifische Variante der englischen Sprache, sondern bezieht sich allgemein auf das in ,Ostasien, und Teilen von ,Südostasien, anzutreffende Charakteristikum, die Phoneme „l“ und „r“ nicht zu unterscheiden.
,Die Entwicklung des ,Englischen zur lingua franca, im 20. Jahrhundert beeinflusst die meisten Sprachen der Welt. Mitunter werden Wörter ersetzt oder bei Neuerscheinungen ohne eigene Übersetzung übernommen. Diese Entwicklung wird von manchen skeptisch betrachtet, insbesondere dann, wenn es genügend ,Synonyme, in der Landessprache gibt. Kritiker merken auch an, es handle sich des Öfteren (beispielsweise bei ,Handy, im Deutschen) um ,Scheinanglizismen,.
,Mitunter wird auch eine unzureichende Kenntnis der englischen Sprache für die Vermischung und den Ersatz bestehender Wörter durch Scheinanglizismen verantwortlich gemacht. So sprechen einer Studie der ,GfK, zufolge nur 2,1 Prozent der deutschen Arbeitnehmer verhandlungssicher Englisch. In der Gruppe der unter 30-Jährigen bewerten jedoch über 54 Prozent ihre Englischkenntnisse als gut bis exzellent.,[15], Zu besseren Sprachkenntnissen könne demzufolge effizienterer Englischunterricht beitragen, und statt der Ton-,Synchronisation, von Filmen und Serien solle eine ,Untertitelung, der englischsprachigen Originale mit Text in der Landessprache erfolgen. Dies würde zugleich zu einer besseren Abgrenzung zwischen den Sprachen und einer Wahrung lokaler Sprachqualität beitragen.,[16],
Im Dezember 2014 forderte der Europapolitiker ,Alexander Graf Lambsdorff,, neben Deutsch die englische Sprache als ,Verwaltungs-, und später als ,Amtssprache in Deutschland, zuzulassen, um die Bedingungen für qualifizierte Zuwanderer zu verbessern, den ,Fachkräftemangel, abzuwenden und Investitionen zu erleichtern.,[17],

,Die Darstellung von ,Grafiken, ist aktuell auf Grund eines Sicherheitsproblems deaktiviert.,Herkunft englischer Wörter in %,
,Eine große Klasse von Unterschieden zwischen der deutschen und der englischen Sprache sind auf die ,zweite Lautverschiebung, zurückzuführen. Dabei liegt die Neuerung auf Seiten der deutschen Sprache; die englische Sprache bewahrt hier den altertümlichen germanischen Zustand. Beispiele sind:
,
,engl. ,t, zu hochdeutsch ,s, in ,water, bzw. ,Wasser, (nach Vokal),
,engl. ,t, zu hochdeutsch ,z, in ,two, bzw. ,zwei, (im Anlaut),
,engl. ,p, zu hochdeutsch ,f, in ,ripe, bzw. ,reif, (nach Vokal),
,engl. ,p, zu hochdeutsch ,pf, in ,plum, bzw. ,Pflaume, (im Anlaut),
,engl. ,k, zu hochdeutsch ,ch, in ,break, bzw. ,brechen, (nach Vokal),
,engl. ,d, zu hochdeutsch ,t, in ,bed, bzw. ,Bett,
,engl. ,th, zu hochdeutsch ,d, in ,three, bzw. ,drei,
,Es gibt jedoch auch Unterschiede, bei denen die deutsche Sprache konservativer ist:
,
,Geschwundenes englisches ,n,, zu beobachten in Englisch ,us,, ,goose, oder ,five, im Vergleich zu hochdeutsch ,uns,, ,Gans, bzw. ,fünf,
,englisch ,f, oder ,v, anstelle von germanischem und deutschem ,b,, zu beobachten in Englisch ,thief, oder ,have, im Vergleich zu hochdeutsch ,Dieb, bzw. ,haben,
,geschwundenes germanisches (und alt- und mittelenglisches) [,x,] (deutscher Ach-Laut) (mit dem Allophon [,ç,], deutscher Ich-Laut), teilweise zu [,f,] gewandelt, im Schriftbild noch an stummem (oder als f ausgesprochenem) ,gh, zu erkennen, zu beobachten in Englisch ,night,, ,right, oder ,laugh, im Vergleich zu hochdeutsch ,Nacht,, ,Recht/richtig, bzw. ,lachen,

,Ilie Purcaru, (5 November 1933 – 10 October 2008) was a Romanian journalist and poet, much of whose writing was in support of the ,communist regime,. A native of the ,Oltenia, region, he had an early debut in the ,Romanian Communist Party, press, and was hailed as a child prodigy in the realm of poetry; trained as a conventional ,Socialist realist,, by the late 1950s he was trying to promote ,Neoconstructivism,, but found himself repressed by ,communist censorship,. Purcaru was recovered for his propaganda-writing, then helped re-establish the ,Craiova,-based magazine ,Ramuri,, which he directed until 1969. Partnering up with ,Miron Radu Paraschivescu,, he provoked censors by publishing ,Onirist, poets, as well as by cultivating former fascists. He was nevertheless largely compatible with the regime's ,national-communist turn,; as a pioneer of the ,reportage, genre, he expanded on influences from ,Geo Bogza, and ,Tudor Arghezi, to create a new, distinctly poetic, language of propaganda. In tandem, Purcaru visited ,Southeast Asia, as a press correspondent, being a personal witness to the ,Vietnamese, and ,Laotian Wars,.
,Though widely seen as a gifted writer even in the realm of propaganda, Purcaru elicited an enduring controversy by veering into the extremes of national-communism, which came with his embracing the views and the linguistic violence of ,Protochronism,. While he remained a relative moderate in this camp, and published an interview with the anti-Protochronist ,Nicolae Manolescu,, he was still treasured by the regime, and as such served in official capacities until the ,Romanian Revolution, of 1989. Embroiled in a corruption scandal, and barred from working in the press, he was defended by ,Adrian Păunescu,, and employed by him at ,Flacăra,. Especially in that context, Purcaru began exploring the life of peasants, described by him as icons of honesty; he also added to the controversy surrounding his life by making repeated contributions to ,Nicolae Ceaușescu's cult of personality,.
,This standing in national-communist literature came alongside a belated return to poetry, with verse that was praised for its tender, bookish, humorous touches. Purcaru remained active after the Revolution, especially as the editor of short-lived publications, one of which was in support of the ,Democratic Laborists,, and another put out by the ,Romanian Hearth Union,. He also served for a while as editorial secretary at ,Dimineața,, of the governing ,Democratic National Salvation Front,. Purcaru was ready to accept the regime change, but found himself shunned by the literary mainstream. In old age, he also joined a new publishing venture launched by Păunescu in opposition to ,Flacăra,. Before his death, Purcaru was reediting his earlier works, issuing the complete notebooks of his journeys in ,North Vietnam, and the ,Kingdom of Laos,.
,
,
,Early life,[,edit,],
,Purcaru was born in the Oltenian city of ,Râmnicu Vâlcea,, then part of the ,Kingdom of Romania,, as the son of Ioan Purcaru and his wife Aurora (née Năchescu), both of whom were schoolteachers;,[1],[2], the couple also had a daughter, Georgeta.,[3], The family's roots were in other parts of Oltenia: Aurora was a native of ,Târgu Cărbunești,, and Ioan came in from ,Craiova,,,[2], but was originally from ,Gura Motrului,.,[4], The writer was always proud of his regional affiliation, confessing in 1972 that he shared the Oltenians' ""egocentric"" mindset, and was only truly moved by news from this area, having an ""Oltenian ear"".,[4], His colleague ,Artur Silvestri, once portrayed him as the ""physical embodiment of the Oltenian writer"": ""short, slender, energetic with his irritability, his gesturing impetuous, interrogative"".,[5],
,The family had preserved the full collection of ,Arhivele Olteniei, journal, put out by the local historian C. D. Fortunescu, whom Ilie got to meet as a child.,[6], Ioan encouraged his son to write, and, later in life, kept count of all his articles.,[4], The Purcarus moved to Craiova when Ilie was aged seven,,[7], renting one of the suburban homes owned by the local industrialist Roth, who also ran ,Nazi Germany,'s local consulate.,[8], Young Purcaru attended primary school during World War II (from 1940 to 1944) and, from 1944 to 1950, ,Frații Buzești High School,.,[9], During his time at the latter institution, he attended a literary circle founded by his teachers Luca Preda and Fanu Duțulescu.,[4], In a 1984 interview, he referred to his direct experience of the ,anti-Nazi coup of August 1944,, during which his family bunked with Roth's wife, who had a look of ""primal fear""; her husband and son had disappeared, never to return.,[8], Purcaru spoke of himself and fellow writer ,Paul Anghel, as participants in ""our revolution"", which had taken place after the coup. Specifically, they had planted posters with slogans favoring the Communist Party, before joining the ,Union of Communist Youth, (UTC) in late 1947.,[8], 
,Purcaru made his debut during the early stages of the communist regime (originally called ""Romanian People's Republic""), though literary historian ,Dumitru Micu, provides two different dates and contexts: either in 1949, with prose published in Craiova's ,Caiet Literar,,,[9], or the following year, with poems taken up by the central magazine ,Contemporanul,[1], (Purcaru himself favored the latter account).,[4], From 1950 to 1951,,[9], he studied at the Mihai Eminescu Literature School in ,Bucharest,, being possibly its youngest-ever student.,[10], In May 1951, one of his contributions to ,young adult literature, were awarded a prize by the specialized publishing house, ,Editura Tineretului,.,[11], One anonymous report filed with the UTC had was also one of several inductees who had decided to drop out of high school, since ""now that they're writers, they [believe that they] no longer need the high school"".,[12], One of his colleagues was the future novelist ,Aurel Rău,, who recalls that Purcaru was regarded as holding ""great promise"".,[13], 
,During the later stages of communism, the Eminescu School's activity came to be seen as ""highly controversial"". In a 1985 interview with ,Mihai Ungheanu,, Purcaru acknowledged this as a fact, but added: ""this school has also produced some writers. People who have rescued and then imposed themselves with their own talent, but also through the help provided by this school."",[14], One of Purcaru's older schoolmates, ,Alexandru Andrițoiu,, declared that Purcaru himself was already an ""exemplary"" poet, whose verse stood out from the rest in ""that barren dogmatic era"".,[10], His period there was nevertheless extended by his induction into the official literary current of ,Socialist realism, (also known as the Romanian "",Proletkult,""); the official press sampled his poetic work, as ""vibrant with the love for the country that is being built"":

,Scînteia, and ,Anul XV,[,edit,],
,Purcaru in the 1950s,
,Though still an adolescent, Purcaru was made an editor at the Communist Party's daily, ,Scînteia,, staying there from 1951 to 1957.,[9], As noted by literary historian ,Ana Selejan,, he was one of that publication's ""top reporters"", and one of the few to have taken up the reportage genre without first going through a fiction-writing stage. She lists Purcaru among other examples of men and women who entered literature by way of ,Scînteia,, including ,Maria Banuș,, ,Dan Deșliu,, ,Petru Dumitriu,, and Victor Bârlădeanu. Their contribution, she adds, were rarely commented on by the regime's literary press, and was mainly regarded as a subset of ,agitprop,, with a ""mobilizing, educational effect"", only differing in that they required actual travels out in the field.,[16], Purcaru himself contributed such texts upon visiting ,Doicești, (1951) and the building site of ,Bicaz Power Station, (1953).,[17], His direct superior at ,Scînteia, was ,Sorin Toma,, with whom he did not get along. In old age, Purcaru recalled that, on his first day, Toma asked him to extend his hand and, upon noticing that it was trembling, asked him: ""What is it that you're not disclosing to the [communist] party?"",[18], Toma, who survived Purcaru, dismissed the account as inaccurate, and advanced instead the claim that Purcaru, like many others of his employees, was a ,high-functioning alcoholic,; if he was checking Purcaru's hands, it was in a search for signs of intoxication.,[18], 
,Purcaru complained in 1984 that he and Anghel were rarely allowed to publish their literary work, which had already branched out of the reportage genre—and that even their contributions as reporters were rarely tolerated by ,communist censors,.,[8], Toma provides a contrasting account, suggesting that Purcaru, as a ""very handsome"" young man, was well-liked by the communist leader, ,Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej,. In order not to disappoint the latter by revealing that Purcaru did not meet ethical standards, ,Scînteia, made efforts to conceal his drinking habits.,[18], Purcaru traveled into the ,Soviet Union,, alongside Valeriu Negru, as press envoys to the ,6th World Festival of Youth and Students, in August 1957.,[19], As one of his last assignments at ,Scînteia,, Purcaru covered the ,Vnukovo International Airport, incident which had resulted in the death of a Romanian communist official, ,Grigore Preoteasa,.,[2], In late 1958, a special issue of ,Viața Romînească,, showcasing the society and culture of ,Northern Dobruja,, featured his piece on the agronomist Năstăsoiu, who had chosen to live permanently on a ,collective farm,. This text was praised in ,Tribuna, magazine for displaying Purcaru's skill as a humorist.,[20], 
,Around that time, Purcaru and his lifelong friend Anghel co-wrote a poem, subsequently taken up by ,George Ivașcu, in ,Contemporanul,. Called ,Anul XV,, and commemorating the events of 1944, it generated some controversy for using ,free verse, and relying on ,Constructivist, imagery. Purcaru later reported that they had consciously challenged ""traditionalist"" taboos, merging the atmosphere of communist rallies with poetic techniques borrowed from ,Vladimir Mayakovsky,, ,Demyan Bedny,, ,Ion Barbu,, and the ,unu, group of avant-garde poets.,[8], Ion Oarcăsu of ,Tribuna, disliked its ""violent abstractization"", but defended its ""accomplished portions"" and ""Mayakovskyian inspiration"".,[21], An anonymous source reported to the ,Securitate, and the censors that the piece was "",surrealistic,"", which resulted in both authors being barred from publishing for a couple of years.,[22], The claim was upheld publicly by critic ,Gabriel Dimisianu, in April 1961, when the argued that the two authors had betrayed the guidelines of Socialist realism by toying with "",futurist, techniques""; Dimisianu however noted that the neo-traditionalist content promoted by other authors was equally wrong.,[23], 
,Anghel was further repressed because of his marriage to the film director ,Malvina Urșianu,, who was suspected by the authorities of being an anticommunist opinion-maker, and detained as such in 1958. Ultimately released later that year, Urșianu credited Purcaru as one of the people who spoke out in her support.,[24], In 1960–1961,,[9], Purcaru had an editorial position at ,Contemporanul,, now working directly under Ivașcu. His colleagues there included Felicia Antip, who recalled that Ivașcu ""never forced authors he respected to write any sort of mendacious, agitprop text [...]. That area was zealously covered by a clique of editors and contributors, comprising ,Vasile Băran, [and] Ilie Purcaru"".,[25], During summer 1961, Purcaru was assigned to do his documentary research in ,Iași Region,.,[26], He later moved offices to ,Luceafărul,, where he worked from 1962 to 1964.,[9], During this time, he traveled the ,Wallachian Plain, to document the harvest; his contribution was included in the 1963 book ,Moment istoric,, wherein various writers offered praise to the ,collectivization of agriculture,.,[27], It was also then that he began his work as an interviewer, centering it on senior literary figures. In a 1983 piece, literary critic Alexandru Oprea described this contribution as commendable, ""in the tradition of a genre constructed by ,Felix Aderca, and ,Ion Biberi,"".,[28], Also then, journalist Nicolae Georgescu assessed that a 1962 interview with ,George Călinescu,, taken by Purcaru and ,Ștefan Bănulescu,, was still a ,Luceafărul, milestone.,[29],
,
,Ramuri, and Vietnam,[,edit,],
,Described by Micu as a born reporter, Purcaru was interested in the most varied contemporary issues. Micu also notes that Purcaru's early years were marked by a predominance of romantic, exalted tones, producing several works: ,Zile fierbinți, (1955, with V. Negru), ,Calitatea producției — onoarea fabricii, (1956), ,Ev nou în Țara Banilor, (1961), ,Harpe și ape. Album dunărean, (1962).,[1],[9], The latter book, comprising accounts of his travels along the ,Danube,, was written on a dare, in a successful attempt out outdoing another reporter, Mihai Stoian.,[4], Most of these works expand on the notion of ,ev nou, (""new era"") as a descriptor for Romania's communization. Some cover more than one volume, presenting as a form of ""monographic reportage"". As noted by Micu, ,Ev nou în Țara Banilor, transcends the ""conventionality and opportunism"" of regular communist writings by embracing subtlety and expanding the means of expression—from historical and sociological essay to ,prose poem,; he detects in it echoes from ,Tudor Arghezi,'s modern hymns and from ,Geo Bogza,'s classic reportage pieces, but also foreshadows of the 1980s propaganda festival, ,Cîntarea României,.,[1], Literary critic ,Alex. Ștefănescu, regards Purcaru and ,Traian T. Coșovei, as ""Bogza's epigones"". They had only borrowed Bogza's ""poetic-bombastic style"" while ignoring his other trait, namely a ""remarkable concreteness"".,[30], Purcaru himself specialized in geographic ,similes,, comparing Oltenia to a bow and (in ,Harpe și ape,) the whole of Romania to a ,harp,, with rivers as the strings. Micu defends such metaphors as still charming, but acknowledges that Purcaru doused them in a ""heavily politicized discourse, reflecting the communist spirit"", thus leaving his readers with a ""feeling of disgust"" (,sentiment de lehamite,).,[1], 
,Purcaru's journalistic contribution was still rewarded in 1964, when he was inducted into the ,Order of Labor (,Ordinul Muncii,),, Third Class.,[31], His rise as a political writer straddled the communist rules of Gheorghiu-Dej and ,Nicolae Ceaușescu,. His books acquired a more pronounced intellectual stance, beginning with the 1964 ,Colocvii. Artistul și opera sa, de la I. L. Caragiale la Eugen Barbu,, where writers were his theme.,[9], As he later informed his readers, ,Colocvii, could not feature his portraits of poets ,Miron Radu Paraschivescu, and ,Ion Vinea,, for ""reasons that were outside my control, and theirs as well."",[4], In ,Escale spre noi înșine,, which appeared at ,Editura Tineretului, in 1966, Purcaru examined ""the phenomenon of our [Romanian] presence abroad"". It brought together the author's own reportage-writing, here distinctly modeled on the eclectic forms cultivated by ,Michel Butor,, with Romanian-themed quotes from international figures (from ,Paul Morand, and ,Miguel Ángel Asturias, to ,Nâzım Hikmet,), and with fragments from the international press.,[32], 
,While serving as chief editor of the Craiova newspaper ,Înainte,,,[2], Purcaru was the founder and first editor of ,Ramuri, magazine, appearing as a publication of ,Craiova Region,'s Committee for Culture and the Arts in 1964.,[33], He was also involved in campaigning for the ,People's Democratic Front, ahead of ,legislative elections in March 1965,, giving introductory speeches to its candidate, ,Ștefan Voitec,.,[34], During that he period, he brought in at ,Ramuri, other authors who favored the reportage genre—examples include Anghel, ,Adrian Păunescu,, and ,Mihai Pelin,.,[33], Here, Purcaru began testing the limits of ,communist liberalization,—under his watch, Paraschivescu founded a supplement, ,Povestea Vorbei,, which published dissenting authors of the ,Onirist, group and other independents.,[33], He declared himself motivated by the Communist Party's 9th Congress, since it had ushered in ""anti-Proletkult and anti-dogmatic literature"", within a ""climate of creative freedom"".,[8], His stance was still seen as suspicious by the authorities. By 1967, the Securitate had planted an informant in Paraschivescu's summer home at ,Vălenii de Munte,, observing him in conversations with his guests. These included writers Purcaru, ,Sidonia Drăgușanu,, ,Dumitru Țepeneag, and ,Alexandru Voitinovici,, as well as the communist potentate ,Gogu Rădulescu,.,[35],
,In 1966–1967,,[36], Purcaru was an accredited press correspondent in the ,Vietnam War,, described from the ,North Vietnamese, side (which also provided him with bodyguards).,[37], In his memoirs, journalist Constantin Poenaru records legends about his departure. According to these, Purcaru had volunteered after being told that he was dying from ,cirrhosis,. ""By who knows what miracle"", he only managed to cure his disease during his extended leave, and was subsequently ""healthy as a horse"" (,sănătos tun,).,[38], He and his wife lived in ,Hanoi, for those two years, during which time a son was born to them.,[2], Purcaru's texts were first bound together as ,Focuri în junglă,, which won him the annual prize of the UTC Central Committee for 1967.,[39], These writings are ""filled with dramatic detail, and with tragedies hardly imaginable just two decades after humanity had known the horrors of World War II"";,[36], according to reviewer ,Laurențiu Ulici,, they also showcase Purcaru as a man of ""altruism and delicacy of sentiment."",[39], Some recount his direct experience of ,Operation Rolling Thunder,, during which he hid out in caves.,[40], In one of his non-site articles for ,Scînteia,, he described the massive effort at destroying a single ""tiny bridge"" in ,Yên Phong district,.,[41], 
,While in Hanoi, Purcaru personally greeted writer ,Blaga Dimitrova,, who came in from the ,People's Republic of Bulgaria,. They became friends, and he was described by Dimitrova as ""one of the most likeable characters to appear in my book"", as well as a direct influence on her writing (by helping her ""do away with tear-jerking lyricism"").,[42], While prevented by the Romanian Embassy from even setting foot in ,South Vietnam, (he would only visit ,Ho Chi Minh City, in the 1980s), he traveled from Hanoi to ,Vientiane, to chronicle the ,Laotian Civil War,.,[43], He managed to interview ,Souphanouvong,, asking him to describe the governing platform of his ,Front for National Development,.,[44], He was surprised to note that the ""Red Prince"", who had visited Romania in the 1930s, still remembered some Romanian words.,[45], According to his personal notebooks, he was still not trusted by Souphanouvong's ,Pathet Lao,, which kept him under close surveillance.,[40], He recalled being put off by the regularity of ,American bombing in Laos,, as it had affected an already destitute people. He himself had to take shelter with regular Laotians in the ,Viengxay caves, outside ,Xam Neua,.,[46], The notebooks also detail his encounter with the isolated ,Miao people,, whom he came to admire for their ""purity of blood"" and military prowess.,[47], Purcaru made a return trip to Craiova in mid-December 1966, when, as a member of the National Committee of Solidarity with the Vietnamese People's Struggle, he organized a workers' rally ""against the acts of aggression performed by ,American imperialism, in Vietnam."",[48],
,
,Protochronist turn,[,edit,],
,Purcaru in 1972,
,In June 1967, Purcaru was interviewed by the UTC's ,Scînteia Tineretului,, to provide it with insight into his writing process. He expressed his admiration for Bogza, but noted that the latter's contributions of 1945 were also a ""solemn funeral"" of the genre—every other such work published since had been copying ""a foreign model, arrived here from some place, the sort of place where there are no opinions, and no actual press, and no actual reportage"". The censorship apparatus picked this out as a reference to ,Soviet propaganda,, and the corresponding fragment was cut out of the interview.,[49], In April 1968, Purcaru also attended a meeting of the Craiova Communists, held in Voitec's presence. He declared himself in favor of raising the ""ideological content of educational work"", by having teachers trained in ,Marxism-Leninism,; he also praised the Party for encouraging ""authentic creativity"", and also for its ,rehabilitation, of Gheorghiu-Dej's victims, including ""first and foremost"" ,Lucrețiu Pătrășcanu,.,[50], Around the same time, ,Ramuri, was being kept under watch by Securitate agents, with one of their anonymous sources reporting that the editorial staff's ""lack of vigilance and discernment"" had led to the publication therein of a note praising ,Nae Ionescu,, hitherto reviled as a pillar of the fascist ,Iron Guard,. The Securitate document also claimed that the magazine had also nearly published works by political suspects, including former Guardists and a one-time member of the ,National Christian Party,.,[51], In the ,Romanian diaspora,, philosopher ,Mircea Eliade,, who had been an Ionescu disciple, declared his surprise, adding a note of skepticism: he feared that ""such 'excesses' might be used by the ,Stalinists, (or whatever they're called) to turn the screws back on them."",[52],
,As a journalist at ,Înainte,, Purcaru was one of the reporters who were assigned to travel the country in Ceaușescu's ,motorcades,.,[53], His contribution to that newspaper is believed to have remained timid in its approach to censorship. This was attested by the essayist and former political prisoner ,Ion Dezideriu Sîrbu,, according to whom: ""[Purcaru] would not publish me [there], knowing that I did not have the right to publish or the right of signature, as sympathetic as he was towards me, until he was granted permission to do so, and that's when they published my article about the ,icon,-thieves in ,Brâncuși's village,."",[54], The editor was still publicly ,anti-Soviet, down to a fracas which occurred at a restaurant on ,Palace Square, during late April 1969. Purcaru was drinking in the company of several journalists, including ,Vartan Arachelian,, when they noticed that Soviet tourists were seated in their proximity; being annoyed by this and by their activity of the time, which was mainly focused on writing a ""festive issue"" for the ,International Workers' Day,, they proceeded to sing forbidden and provocative songs (including ,Trăiască Regele,, "",Lili Marleen,"", and an Iron Guard hymn).,[55], The incident resulted in permanent surveillance by the Securitate for a one-year interval, as well as in a number of administrative sanctions. The instigators were dressed down by the Minister of Youth, ,Ion Iliescu,, who chided the teetotaler Arachelian for having allowed Purcaru to sing, instead of ""slapping him once or twice"".,[55],
,In mid-1969, Purcaru was replaced at ,Ramuri, with the academic ,Alexandru Piru,, who steered that magazine away from reportage-writing, promoting instead literary theory and history.,[33], Around 1970, Purcaru made visits to the island of ,Ada Kaleh,, which was soon after submerged into the Danube upon the construction of an ,Iron Gates hydroelectric dam,. Like his colleagues Pelin and Coșovei, he wrote texts in support of the controlled destruction—all three writers argued that the island was merely a relic of the past, standing in the way of industrial progress.,[56], From 1972 to 1973, Purcaru  was deputy editor-in-chief at ,Înainte,, holding a similar post at ,Scînteia Tineretului, (1973–1974). He was then editor at ,Argeș, magazine in 1974, and in 1974–1975,[9], served as deputy editor-in-chief at ,Tribuna României,, where Anghel was the manager.,[2],
,The interview-collection ,Poezii și politică,, put out by ,Editura Albatros, in 1972, was applauded by reviewer ,George Pruteanu, for its value as a ""rare documentary""—since it included encounters with Paraschivescu, Vinea and ,Petre Pandrea,, all of whom had since died; overall, Pruteanu notes, the interviews doubled as ""scenarios for intellectual disputes."",[57], The book also featured Purcaru's talks with Păunescu, who had recently returned from a study trip in the United States, and expanded on themes of ,socialist patriotism,. Therein, Păunescu explained himself as a committed left-winger, whose politics had been shaped by Paraschivescu, and who was therefore ""terrified by some aspects of American culture"": ""Americans want money, money, money! They would pursue any business even if it contradicted their personal beliefs."",[58], Purcaru himself followed up with new works in the reportage genre: ,Țara Banilor, (1972), ,Un elefant pentru doi oameni, (1973), and ,Asaltul, (1974). The second of these, advertised as a presentation of the world's ""young civilizations"", was named after the supposed 1/2 ratio of ,Indian elephants, to humans in Laos.,[4],[45], It described his travels in ,Southeast Asia,, but also in ,Siberia,, ,Alaska,, and ,Cuba,. His former colleague at ,Ramuri,, Romulus Diaconescu, suggests that the work was praiseworthy for its descriptions of moods and landscapes, with influences from ,Mihail Sadoveanu,.,[59], In ,Asaltul,, Purcaru reconstructed the ,1944 insurrection, as played out in Craiova and ,Caracal,, and specifically on the image of ""communists lead[ing] the masses toward victory"".,[60],
,In a 1972 interview, Purcaru expressed his admiration of the constructors' class, arguing that their justified pride gave communized Romania an ongoing source of ""social contradictions""—one which reporters needed to investigate.,[4], He explored such themes in the 1975 volume ,România – convergențe la universal,. According to a review by Al. I. Friduș in ,Cronica, weekly, it was a ""seductive colloquium"" of interviews, with, among others, Călinescu, ,Ion Barbu,, ,Henri Coandă,, ,Zoe Dumitrescu-Bușulenga,, ,Stephen Fischer-Galați,, ,Zoltán Franyó,, ,Octav Onicescu,, ,Alexandru Rosetti,, and ,Henri H. Stahl,. These were selected to have two unifying subjects, namely the universality of Romanian contributions in culture and science, and the ""fundamental idea"" defining Romanians as a people.,[61], Literary scholar ,Eugen Negrici, identifies Purcaru, Păunescu and Anghel, alongside ,Eugen Barbu, and ,Corneliu Vadim Tudor,, as the journalists and writers most prone to serving the regime's ,national-communist, propaganda after 1975. According to Negrici, these authors readily agreed to make the transition away from ""honest reviews"" of ,Romanian nationalism, and into the realm of outright falsification.,[62], American anthropologist ,Katherine Verdery,, who visited Romania in the 1980s, studied Purcaru as an exponent of "",Protochronism,"", which constituted the most radical form of national-communism, by presuming Romanian world-primacy in various fields of culture. In his own words, Purcaru was rebelling against a ""defeatist doctrine that divides the world into major and minor cultures"", adding: ""Protochronism seeks the annulment of norms that place a literature in excessive creative dependence and subordination to the values of other literatures."",[63], He was nevertheless among those who extended an offer of collaboration to the advocates of full ,Westernization,, also called ""Synchronists"", in that he believed that the two currents shared the same ultimate agenda.,[64],

,Flacăra, and ,Bunica Beps,[,edit,],
,Ion Predoșanu's photograph, illustrating Purcaru's reportage in ,Hobița-Peștișani,, at the family home of sculptor ,Constantin Brâncuși,. Published with the caption: ""From Brâncuși's own well, Dumitraș, who is the sculptor's great-great-grandnephew, drinks up a kind of water that many bystanders, obviously, hold to be the ,water of life,"",
,Poenaru, who witnessed Purcaru's return trips to Râmnicu Vâlcea, notes that he continued to feed his alcohol problem by ""engag[ing] in lengthy libations"", to the point of neglecting his work. According to the same source, he would always collect his money in advance, spend it, then write his articles on the preceding night, scribbling them down in a small notebook.,[65], Purcaru's career was for a while threatened—according to Păunescu, he ""was fired from all places"", despite being a ""great journalist."",[66], Verdery contrarily reports that the regime allowed Purcaru to engage in acts of corruption: ""the protochronists were generally rescued from above in the numerous scrapes they got themselves into. [...] Paul Anghel and Ilie Purcaru were involved in a scandal concerning misappropriation of foreign currency from a journal they edited; yet although they were fired, their careers proceeded apace."",[67], From 1975 to 1987,,[9], Purcaru served as the editor of ,Flacăra, weekly, having been brought there by Păunescu.,[2],[66],[68],
,Micu notes that Purcaru's youthful romanticism had become more subdued in the collection ,Paralaxe la ""Miorița"", (1978); other works of the period include ,Încă 3 km până la Apele Vii, (1976) and ,Planuri în lut, (1979).,[1],[9], ,Paralaxe, was one of several works by Purcaru which provided a minute, monographic investigation of peasant life. Covering the work for ,Scînteia Tineretului,, Ștefănescu recognized Bogza's influence, and declared himself put off by Purcaru's occasional ""grandiloquence"", but asserted that, overall, the book showed its author's ""fantasy and sensibility"", as well as an ""authenticity of the lyrical élan"". During his research, Purcaru had traveled to the ,Transylvanian, village of ,Drăguș,, retracing Stahl's sociological research, and meeting an unusually strong and industrious local, Bacioc, who had spent decades building himself a gigantic ,log house,.,[69], ,Încă 3 km, gathered impressions of his time with the peasants and rural craftsmen of Oltenia, with incursions in ,Arcani,, ,Fîntîna Domnească,, ,Runcu,, and the eponymous ,Apele Vii,. He described the fading-out of superstitions (by interviewing a peasant who had once believed that the sun was like ""the mouth of a barrel""), the quick adoption of modern tools, but also the ""fundamental honesty"" of rural folk.,[70], In ,Planuri în lut, and other writings, Purcaru is visibly alarmed by the destitution of ancestral villages in his native ,Vâlcea County,, and especially in the isolated sub-region known as ,Țara Loviștei,.,[3],
,The reporter occasionally gave way to the poet, as with the volumes ,Bunica Beps, (1974) and ,Geografii rebele, (1984), and the commemorative piece ,Marșul de August, (1980).,[1],[9], Only the first of these three volumes is noted by Micu, who remarks that it relied on ""tenderness, expressed with an intellectual humor reflecting a bookish source"";,[1], it earned the author another prize, granted by the Bucharest Writers' Association.,[2], Purcaru suffused this work with ,intertexual, allusions to diverse authors of the 20th century—from ,Ștefan Octavian Iosif, to Ion Barbu, ,Mateiu Caragiale,, ,Radu Stanca,, and especially Călinescu.,[1], According to Pelin, the volume also struck a serious note, showing Purcaru's ""acute feeling of time"", of his own self being wasted away.,[71], In an interview with Alice Diana Boboc, Purcaru would acknowledge the more playful side of his nature, including as a reporter, describing himself overall as a ""good-natured fella"".,[72], He also noted that poetry remained a pastime: ""I am not one of those fortunate enough to be visited by poetic inspiration on a daily basis. It won't even visit me on Sundays."",[14],
,Purcaru continued to receive awards, such as the ,Writers' Union of Romania, Prize (1975) and the Craiova Writers' Association Prize (1980).,[9], His contribution at ,Flacăra, included a 1981 exposé on some unpunished acts of ,mobbing,. Though intended as a way of getting the authorities involved, it inspired ,Norman Manea, to write his novel ,Plicul negru,, which was a covert critique of Ceaușescu's supremacy.,[73], At that stage, Purcaru himself was openly critical of the regime's cultural policies, as was his painter friend Mihai Bandac. According to the latter, they feared Securitate reprisals, but were protected by Vadim Tudor, who knew a Securitate general, Aron Bordea.,[74], Purcaru remained supportive of ,Ceaușescu's personality cult,, with contributions to a 1983 ,Festschrift, called ,Omagiu președintelui țării,, which was Oltenian-centered and put out by ,Scrisul Românesc, of Craiova. The text, which included an account of Purcaru's visit to the ,Conducător,',s home village in ,Scornicești,, was critically reread in 2006 by writer ,Angelo Mitchievici,: ""Ilie Purcaru gets strongly emotional [...]. The reporter, aided by the testimonials of simple folk, but also by those of [party] activists, reconstructs the history of this ancestral homeland, which has reached an unprecedented prosperity under the Gilded Epoch."",[75], Purcaru claimed to have witnessed the locals' enthusiasm about the effects of collectivization; he also reported his meeting with a mother of eleven, who had recollections about the Ceaușescu as a young communist being taken away by the old-regime ,Gendarmes,.,[75], The oral accounts collected by Purcaru (and seen by fellow journalist Nicolae Coande as most likely mendacious) have it that, as a child, Ceaușescu walked in the nearby forest without ever fearing its wolves.,[76], As noted by Mitchievici, the narrative presented itself as unwitting evidence of national-communist "",Messianism,"".,[75],
,
,Literatură și națiune,[,edit,],
,Purcaru spent much of that period interviewing other writers for ,Flacăra,: in June 1983, he also became the last person to converse about literature with the ailing and exhausted ,Nichita Stănescu,, recording ""hints of a [Stănescu] testament"".,[77], His 1981 conversation with ,Ion Lăncrănjan, was affected by censorship, which cut out details on current politics and the formation of writer's ""groups""—though all such mentions could appear in Purcaru's collection, appearing in 1986 at ,Editura Eminescu, as ,Literatură și națiune,.,[78], The volume included Purcaru's own thoughts on the literary and political dispute between national-communists and liberals. In his encounter with literary historian ,Pompiliu Marcea,, he included a positive reference to Ceaușescu's own critique of ""cosmopolitanism"" in art; with Eugen Barbu, he discussed supposed acts of betrayal by his former ,Ramuri, colleague, ,Ion Caraion,.,[79], As noted by Verdery, Purcaru had developed ""one powerful way of undermining others' cultural representativeness"", which was to ""accuse them of 'elitism'."",[80], Further, ""[his] message to a cognizant public is that it should reject the sorts of readings offered by these 'elitists,' who allegedly hold the intelligence of common readers and the values of rural folk in contempt."",[81], The same discourse was employed by his interviewee ,Artur Silvestri,, who argued that those seeking to ""depoliticize"" literature were subject to ideological commands received from ,Radio Free Europe,, and as such no less political then the national-communists.,[82],
,Literatură și națiune, was published at a time when disputes between liberals (who criticized Ceaușescu) and national-communists (who endorsed him) were turning increasingly virulent; the liberals accused their adversaries of being crypto-fascists, while the national-communists became interested in exposing the liberals for being frequently ,Jewish,. The latter theory had been embraced in the 1970s by Eugen Barbu, whose period diaries describe Păunescu as intolerably ,philosemitic,. According to Barbu, ,Flacăra, was always primarily staffed by Jews, including after the reshuffle of that period; the ""handful of Romanians [include] Purcaru, who was and always will be a great reporter."",[68], Siding with the national-communist intellectuals, a Securitate source alleged, already in 1980, that Purcaru and other Protochronists had found themselves marginalized as the "",New Right,"" by intriguers, namely ""a nonconformist group created around ,România Literară, magazine, especially [including] those writers who are of Jewish nationality"".,[83], Purcaru's interviews are analyzed by Verdery as an important piece of evidence regarding the magnitude of cultural debates under late-stage communism; in that context, he ""provoked his interlocutors with ,leading questions, about how 'certain critics' had attacked their work"".,[84], The interviewees' language, she notes, had descended to ""a level of linguistic violence suited only to a full-scale societal crisis."",[85], ,Florin Mugur,, the Romanian Jewish poet and diarist, claimed that in January 1983 a drunken Purcaru phoned him at home from ,Flacăra,',s offices, angry that he was being made to remove portions of a text. According to Mugur, Purcaru blamed this continued censorship on ,voi, jidanii, (""you, the kikes"").,[86], 
,
,Ion Cucu's photograph of Purcaru in 1983,
,Although the Lăncrănjan interview appeared without cuts, this was probably not the case with other portions of the book. As reported by Verdery, the text featured ""outrageous"" attacks on the Writers' Union, for which reason Editura Eminescu ""refused it outright"". It was afterwards ""pressured into accepting it, but only after cutting some interviews and toning down others."",[87], In the book itself, Purcaru had hinted that there was a conspiracy ""against reediting certain writers; some of his protochronist interlocutors agreed with his opinions but others of them pointed to the quite objective difficulties of editing one or another writer's work."",[88], In its published form, ,Literatură și națiune, still featured occasional answers from the liberal side. While ,Mircea Iorgulescu, had specifically asked not to be interviewed by Purcaru, since the latter had once called him a ,sumbru condeier, (""gloomy scribbler""),,[89], the liberal reply was carried by ,România Literară,',s ,Nicolae Manolescu,. Manolescu was allowed to describe his own version of patriotism (implicitly defending himself against national-communist labels on his work), and also insisted that Protochronism, as a variant of patriotism, was flawed: ""Our pride should not consist in being first but in being great."",[90], As Verdery notes, Manolescu hinted that the best way of dealing with his adversaries was to ""refuse them a dialogue"".,[91], Unwittingly, the Manolescu–Purcaru encounter also showed a number of similarities between the two opposing camps, since they were both irked by the state of cultural management under Ceaușescu: ""They reflect real and understandable frustration at the reduced number of publications and the stiff competition to get one's works into print, a process in which it was insinuated that 'certain critics' or writers had undue influence (even though the real cause lay in the Party's cultural policy)."",[92],
,Interviewing Purcaru shortly before the ,Romanian Revolution, toppled communism, Verdery noted that he still produced some of ""the most extreme protochronist statements""—on par with those by Anghel, Eugen Barbu, Lăncrănjan, Silvestri and Tudor, and much more radical than those aired by Păunescu or ,Constantin Noica,.,[93], At the time, Purcaru also decried the near-disappearance of ,proletarian literature,, arguing that its representation in Ceaușescu's Romania was below interwar levels. As he put it in 1984, ""the drama of the petty bourgeois who was ruffled up by the revolution [...] is a more interesting subject for our writers than the colossal struggle of workers toward constructing a new Romania."",[8], In the mid-1986, he and fellow Protochronist ,Mihai Ungheanu, wrote in support of Romania during a cross-border dispute with the ,Hungarian People's Republic,. Specifically, they argued that the Hungarian-speaking ,Csángós, in ,Western Moldavia, were ""a de-nationalised community of ethnic Romanians""—thus endorsing theories presented by Dumitru Mărtinaș, a grade-school teacher.,[94], 
,In parallel, Purcaru researched a book about the regional identity of Oltenia, appearing in 1988 as ,Carte cu olteni,. Written primarily as a memoir in the style of ,Jean Cocteau,, it mixed in fragments of dialogue, monograph, and biography (with portraits of cultural figures from ,Constantin Brâncuși, to ,Magdalena Rădulescu,).,[95], On Ceaușescu's 70th birthday in January of that year, he contributed to another ,Festschrift,, put out by Editura Eminescu as ,Magistralele luminii,. Here, he spoke of the ""grandiose project of the Nicolae Ceaușescu Epoch"", namely the ""earth's rebuilding"".,[96], Almost a full year year ahead of the Revolution, he was again endorsing the personality cult, appearing as a narrator of the propaganda film ,Sub arcul de lumină al Epocii de aur, (aired on ,national television, just ahead of Ceaușescu's 71st birthday).,[31],
,
,1989 Revolution and later life,[,edit,],
,Purcaru returned on national television during a live broadcast on 5 January, just days after ,Ceaușescu's trial and execution,. According to his critics at ,România Literară,, he used this opportunity to engage in a dispute with one of ,Ceaușescu's six prominent critics,, who had ""risked his liberty by going against the tyrant."" ,România Literară, suggested that Purcaru ""ought to have spent this time at home, as a spectator."",[79], He still sought work in the post-revolutionary press, and, as early as January 1990, was a contributor to the newly launched ,Democrația, daily.,[97], The following month, journalist Anemone Popescu spoke out against this publication as a ""diversionary"" enterprise, with Purcaru executing, ""with only a slight delay caused by his alcoholism"", orders received from the national-communist ,Eugen Florescu,. Together, Florescu and Purcaru announced their intention of forming a ""New Society Party"".,[98], Purcaru was then editor-in-chief of several short-lived publications, beginning in April 1990 with ,Fapta, magazine. This was an also an organ of the ,Democratic Party of Labor,, with an editorial staff which also included Protochronists Ungheanu and ,Ilie Bădescu, (prompting the staff chronicler at ,România Literară, to remark that it was ""the defunct ,Luceafărul,, rising out of its ashes"").,[99], In September 1992, he and fellow ,Fapta, contributor Ieronim Buga were sued by former dissident ,Doina Cornea,, whom they had both written about. They were found liable of ,defamation, by a Paris court.,[100],
,In 1990–1991,,[9], Purcaru was employed by ,Națiunea, daily newspaper, which, during his tenure, was purchased by ,Iosif Constantin Drăgan, and turned into a central organ of the nationalist ,Romanian Hearth Union,.,[101], As reported by the ,Hungarian Romanian, journal ,Média,, Purcaru had embraced ""extreme chauvinistic-nationalist views"", but still had his contract terminated by Drăgan.,[102], After a stint at ,România Internațională, magazine,,[9], in October 1992 he was announced as editorial secretary of ,Dimineața,, a daily put out by ,Ion Iliescu,'s ,Democratic National Salvation Front,. This followed an editorial reshuffle, with Purcaru being presented as a professional, voted in by his peers and vetted by Iliescu personally.,[103], Purcaru also worked as editor-in-chief and columnist at ,România Magazin,, launched in March 1996 by fellow writer ,Fănuș Neagu,.,[104], He was then also head editor at ,Regăsirea, (1997).,[9], Purcaru's contribution to propaganda was being retrospectively reviewed by the anticommunist culture-critic ,Virgil Ierunca,, in the 1994 essay ,Dimpotrivă,. Ierunca dismissed his work as ""state-run lying, with fervor and ineffable cynicism"".,[105], Fellow journalist Șerban Cionoff argues that Purcaru sincerely welcomed the change of regime, though the emerging cultural figures had proceeded to marginalize him: ""the spot that should have been reserved for betterment and for solidarity toward a durable creativity was taken by hatred, by murkiness, by a vigilantism of the ,Taliban, rite"".,[2],
,Purcaru's contributions to poetry were grouped as ,Mauzoleul Bunicii Beps,, appearing in 1999.,[1],[9], Also that year, ,George Arion, published a book of interviews, which included one with Purcaru.,[18], In 2001, he joined Păunescu's writing team at ,Flacăra lui Adrian Păunescu,, which was founded in opposition to the old ,Flacăra,.,[106], Victor Rusu, a former colleague in the communist press who had settled in Israel, exchanged letters with Purcaru, publishing them in 2007. These reveal Purcaru's frustration at having to work as a ""mercenary"" for the conceited Păunescu, especially since the job required ""never stepping on the turf of any of the boss' partisans"". He complained that his much younger colleagues were poorly educated, ""scatterbrained, stammering as writers, at odds with logic and grammar, always but always miffed, unfed, and disabused."",[107], He also provided Rusu with scoops regarding the corruption in the ruling ,Social Democratic Party,, alleging that its leader, ,Adrian Năstase,, was buying off entire mountains for his own private use.,[108],
,The former reporter republished all his Danube-themed prose as the volume ,Eu și Dunărea,, appearing at Floarea Albastră of Bucharest in 2003.,[109], In November of the following year, he received the ""Geo Bogza Award"" at the Dolj County Autumn Gala.,[110], In December 2005, ,Ramuri, celebrated its centennial (counted from the first edition of 1905). The ceremony, attended by Manolescu on behalf of the Writers' Union, saw Purcaru receiving a special award in recognition for his work.,[111], He also made return trips to his native city, where, in 2006, he reissued and completed some of his Vietnam-era writings, as ,Coșmar în junglă,—published by the local company, Antim Ivireanul.,[112], The same company published a volume of his verse in both Romanian and French. It was released that same year with official backing and an international promotion (both of which were seen as distasteful by literary critic ,Dan C. Mihăilescu,).,[113], Purcaru survived his wife, who had committed suicide by hanging in April 1995.,[114], The writer himself died in Bucharest on 10 October 2008, weeks before his 75th birthday,,[72], and was buried four days later at Străulești II Cemetery.,[115], He was survived by a daughter, Anda.,[3], By 2012, the Craiova section of the Writers' Union was granting an ""Ile Purcaru Award"";,[116], in 2013, Antim Ivireanul issued ,Pro Honorem,, a collection of texts in memory of Purcaru.,[3],[72],

,History,[,edit,],
,For a chronological guide, see ,Timeline of Boulder, Colorado,.,
,Archaeological evidence shows the Boulder valley has been continuously inhabited by Native American tribes for over 13,000 years, beginning in the late Pleistocene era. Throughout the Paleo-Indian, Archaic, and Late Prehistoric periods, Indigenous peoples moved seasonally between the mountains and plains, taking shelter in winter along the Front Range trough where Boulder now lies. By the 1500s, the area was occupied by Ute tribes, joined by Arapaho tribes in the early 1800s.,[11],
,The Indigenous Nations who have ties to the Boulder Valley include the Apache, Arapaho, Cheyenne, Comanche, Kiowa, Pawnee, Shoshone, Sioux, and Ute peoples. In the 1800s, Euro-American settlers colonized the area.,[12],
,Modern Boulder was founded in late 1858 when prospectors led by Thomas Aikins arrived at Boulder Canyon during the Colorado Gold Rush. Arapaho leader Niwot allowed them to stay for the winter, but this decision ultimately cost his people their land. In early 1859, gold was discovered along Boulder Creek, drawing more miners and merchants to the area. The Boulder City Town Company was formed in February 1859 to establish a settlement at the canyon mouth. By 1860 it had 70 cabins, mostly occupied by Anglo families. Non-whites like Chinese miners and black residents were part of early Boulder but rarely pictured.,[13],
,In 1861, Boulder County was created and the Arapaho were forced to relocate per the Treaty of Fort Wise. With declining numbers, Niwot's band soon moved to the Cheyenne-Arapaho Reservation. By 1862 the creek had yielded $100,000 in gold and Boulder's population exceeded 300.
,On November 7, 1861, the ,Colorado General Assembly, passed legislation to locate the University of Colorado in Boulder.,[14], On September 20, 1875, the first cornerstone was laid for the first building (Old Main) on the CU campus. The university officially opened on September 5, 1877.,[15],
,In 1907, Boulder adopted an anti-,saloon, ordinance.,[16], Statewide ,prohibition, started in Colorado in 1916,[17], and ended with the repeal of national prohibition in 1933.
,
, ,Boulder in 1900,
,Housing,[,edit,],
,Median home prices rose 60% over the period 2010 to 2015 to $648,200.,[18], In 2024, the City Council of Boulder repealed a long-standing law that prevented Boulder from increasing new residential units by more than 1% in a year.,[19],
,In 1959, city voters approved the ""Blue Line"" city-charter amendment which restricted city water service to altitudes below 5,750 feet (1,750 m), in an effort to protect the mountain backdrop from development. In 1967, city voters approved a dedicated sales tax for the acquisition of open space in an effort to contain ,urban sprawl,. In 1970, Boulder created a ""comprehensive plan"" that would dictate future zoning, transportation, and urban planning decisions. Hoping to preserve residents' views of the mountains, in 1972, the city enacted an ordinance limiting the height of newly constructed buildings. A Historic-Preservation Code was passed in 1974, and a ,residential-growth management, ordinance (the Danish Plan) in 1976.,[20],[21],
,
,Geography,[,edit,],
,Boulder's rock formations, the ,Flatirons,
,The city of Boulder is located in the Boulder Valley, where the ,Rocky Mountains, meet the ,Great Plains,. The ,Flatirons,, slabs of sedimentary stone tilted up on the foothills, are located west of the city, and are a widely recognized symbol of Boulder.,[22],
,Boulder Creek, is the primary flow of water through Boulder. The creek was named prior to the city's founding, for all of the large granite boulders that have cascaded into the creek over the eons.,[,citation needed,], It is from Boulder Creek that the city is believed to have taken its name.,[,citation needed,], Boulder Creek has significant water flow, derived primarily from snow melt and minor springs west of the city.,[,citation needed,], The creek flows into ,St. Vrain Creek, east of ,Longmont,, which is a tributary of the ,South Platte River,.
,At the ,2020 United States Census,, the city had a total area of 17,514 acres (70.877 km,2,), including 664 acres (2.689 km,2,) of water.,[6],
,The ,40th parallel, (40 degrees north latitude) runs through Boulder and can be easily recognized as ,Baseline Road, today.
,Boulder lies in a wide basin beneath ,Flagstaff Mountain, just a few miles east of the continental divide and about 25 miles (40 km) northwest of Denver. Arapahoe Glacier provides water for the city, along with Boulder Creek, which flows through the center of the city.,[23],
,Denver International Airport, is located 45 miles (72 km) southeast of Boulder.,[24],
,
,Environment,[,edit,],
,Government preservation of open space around Boulder began with the ,Congress of the United States, approving the allocation of 1,800 acres (7.3 km,2,) of mountain backdrop/watershed extending from South Boulder Creek to Sunshine Canyon in 1899.
,
,Wildlife protection,[,edit,],
,Boulder has created an Urban Wildlife Management Plan which sets policies for managing and protecting urban wildlife.,[25], Also, the city's Parks and Recreation and Open Space and Mountain Parks departments have volunteers who monitor parks (including wetlands, lakes, etc.) to protect ecosystems.,[26], From time to time, parks and hiking trails are closed to conserve or restore ecosystems.,[27],
Traditionally, Boulder has avoided the use of chemical ,pesticides, for controlling the insect population. However, with the threat of ,West Nile virus,, the city began an ,integrative, ,plan, to control the mosquito population in 2003 that includes chemical pesticides. Residents can ,opt-out, of the program by contacting the city and asking that their areas not be sprayed.,[28],
,Under Boulder law, extermination of ,prairie dogs, requires a permit.,[29],
,Also in 2005, the city experimented with using goats for weed control in environmentally sensitive areas. Goats naturally consume diffuse ,knapweed, and ,Canada thistle,, and although the program was not as effective as it was hoped, goats will still be considered in the future weed control projects. In 2010, goats were used to keep weeds under control at the Boulder Reservoir.,[30],
,The city's Open Space and Mountain Parks department manages approximately 8,000 acres (32 km,2,) of protected forest land west of the city in accordance with a 1999 Forest Ecosystem Management Plan. The plan aims to maintain or enhance native plant and animal species, their communities, and the ecological processes that sustain them and to reduce the wildfire risk to forest and human communities.,[31],

,Autumn in Boulder,
,Snowfall is common in Boulder throughout the winter.,
,Boulder has a temperate climate typical for much of the state and receives many sunny or mostly sunny days each year. Under the ,Köppen climate classification,, the city is considered ,semi-arid, (Köppen: ,BSk,) or ,humid subtropical, (Köppen: ,Cfa,) as it falls near that precipitation boundary, due to its relatively high yearly precipitation and average temperatures remaining above 32 °F (0 °C) year-round.,[32],[33],[34],[35], Winter conditions range from generally mild to the occasional bitterly cold, with highs averaging in the mid to upper 40s °F (7–9 °C). There are 4.6 nights annually during which the temperature reaches 0 °F (−18 °C). Because of ,orographic lift,, the mountains to the west often dry out the air passing over the ,Front Range,, often shielding the city from precipitation in winter, though heavy snowfalls may occur. Snowfall averages 88 inches (220 cm) per season, but snow depth is usually shallow; a strong warming sun due to the high elevation can quickly melt snow cover during the day, and ,Chinook winds, bring rapid warm-ups throughout the winter months. Summers are warm, with frequent afternoon thunderstorms. Roughly 30 days reach 90 °F (32 °C) or above each year.,[36], ,Diurnal temperature variation, is typically large due to the high elevation and semi-arid climate. Daytime highs are generally cooler than those of most Colorado cities with similar elevations. However, Boulder's nighttime lows are mild, particularly during winter. The average January temperature of 34.5 °F (1.4 °C) is the warmest of any city in the state.,[37], 
The highest recorded temperature of 104 °F (40 °C) occurred most recently on June 25, 2012.,[38], The record low was −33 °F (−36 °C) on January 17, 1930. The coldest high temperature, −12 °F (−24 °C), was recorded on February 4, 1989, while the warmest overnight low was recorded on July 20, 1998, with a temperature of 82 °F (28 °C),[39],

,Media,[,edit,],
,Main article: ,Media in Boulder, Colorado,
,Boulder's main daily newspaper, the ,Daily Camera,, was founded in 1890 as the weekly ,Boulder Camera,, and became a daily newspaper the following year. The ,Colorado Daily, was started in 1892 as a university newspaper for CU Boulder. Following many heated controversies over ,Colorado Daily,'s, political coverage, it severed its ties to the university in 1971. In summer 1996, the ,Boulder Planet,, a free weekly competing with the ,Boulder Weekly,, published its first issue; it ceased publication in February 2000.,[88], Newspaper conglomerate ,Scripps, acquired the ,Colorado Daily, in 2005 after its acquisition of the ,Camera, in 1997, leaving the ,Boulder Weekly, as the only locally owned newspaper in Boulder. Scripps relinquished its 50 percent ownership in both daily papers in early 2009 to Media News Group. ,Boulder Magazine,, a lifestyle magazine, was founded in 1978.,[89], ,Boulder Magazine, is published three times per year.
,Boulder is part of the ,Denver, market for television stations, and it also receives many radio stations based in Denver or ,Ft. Collins,. For cable television, Boulder is served by ,Comcast Cable,. The city operates public service Boulder 8 TV on cable (high- and standard-definition), which airs, live-streams and archives council meetings; with its in-house video production facilities, it also produces news, talk and informational programming.,[90], Over-the-air television reception is poor in the western part of the city because of interference from mountains.
,Non-commercial ,community radio, station ,KGNU, was founded in 1978,[91], and commercial music station ,KBCO, in 1977. KBCO programs an ,adult album alternative, format and is owned and operated by ,iHeartMedia,. KBCO moved its studios from Boulder to the ,Denver Tech Center, in 2010,[92], but still maintains the Boulder license and transmits from atop ,Eldorado Mountain, south of Boulder.,[93],
,KVCU,, also known as Radio 1190, is another non-commercial radio station run with the help of university-student volunteers. KVCU started broadcasting in 1998.,[94],
,NPR, programming is heard over ,KCFC, 1490 AM, operated by ,Colorado Public Radio,, and simulcasting Denver station ,KCFR, 90.1.
,KRKS-FM, 94.7, owned and operated by ,Salem Media Group, and affiliated with SRN News, offers a ,Christian talk and teaching, format, and has its transmitter located on Lee Hill, northwest of Boulder.

Brown. In 1974, Lund bought out Brown's share of the press, and Brown moved on to found ,Soldier of Fortune, magazine the following year.,[98],
,
,Infrastructure,[,edit,],
,Transportation,[,edit,],
,A view of the city from northbound US 36 as the highway descends into Boulder,
,Since Boulder has operated under residential growth control ordinances since 1976, the growth of employment in the city has far outstripped population growth. Considerable road traffic enters the city each morning and leaves each afternoon, since many employees live in ,Longmont,, ,Lafayette,, ,Louisville,, ,Broomfield,, ,Westminster,, and ,Denver,. Boulder is served by ,US 36, and a variety of state highways. Parking regulations in Boulder have been explicitly designed to discourage parking by commuters and to encourage the use of mass transit, with mixed results.,[99],
,Over the years, Boulder has made significant investments in the multi-modal network. The city is now well known for its grade-separated bicycle and pedestrian paths, which are integrated into a network of bicycle lanes, cycle tracks, and on-street bicycle routes. Boulder also provides a community transit network that connects downtown, the University of Colorado campuses, and local shopping amenities. While the city has no rail transit, local and regional shuttle busses are funded by a variety of sources. Due in part to these investments in pedestrian, bicycle, and transit infrastructure, Boulder has been recognized both nationally and internationally for its transportation system.,[100],
,In 2009, the Boulder metropolitan statistical area (MSA) ranked as the fourth highest in the United States for percentage of commuters who biked to work (5.4 percent).,[101], In 2013, the Boulder MSA ranked as the fourth lowest in the United States for percentage of workers who commuted by private automobile (71.9 percent). During the same time period, 11.1 percent of Boulder area workers had no commute whatsoever: they worked out of the home.,[102],
,
,Bus service,[,edit,],
,Boulder has an extensive bus system operated by the ,Regional Transportation District, (RTD). The HOP, SKIP, JUMP, Bound, DASH and Stampede routes run throughout the city and connect to nearby communities with departures every ten minutes during peak hours, Monday-Friday. Other routes, such as the 204, 205, 206, 208 and 209 depart every 15 to 30 minutes. Regional routes, traveling between nearby cities such as Longmont (BOLT, J), Golden (GS), and Denver (Flatiron Flyer,,[103], a ,bus rapid transit, route), as well as ,Denver International Airport, (AB), are also available. There are over 100 scheduled daily bus trips on seven routes that run between Boulder and Denver on weekdays.,[104],
,
,Railroads,[,edit,],
,Freight service is provided by ,Union Pacific, and ,BNSF,.
,Currently there is no intercity passenger service. The last remaining services connecting the Front Range cities ceased with the formation of ,Amtrak, in 1971.
,
,Future transit plans,[,edit,],
,Front Range Passenger Rail, is a current proposal (as of 2023) to link the cities from ,Pueblo, in the south, north to ,Fort Collins, and possibly to ,Cheyenne, Wyoming,.,[105],
,A 41-mile (66 km) RTD ,commuter rail, route called the Northwest Rail Line is proposed to run from Denver through Boulder to ,Longmont,, with stops in major communities along the way. The Boulder station is to be north of Pearl Street and east of 30th Street. At one time this commuter rail service was scheduled to commence in 2014, but major delays have ensued. In 2016, an initial 6-mile (9.7 km) segment opened, reaching from downtown Denver to southern ,Westminster, at West 71st Avenue and Federal Boulevard.,[106], The remaining 35 miles (56 km) of the Northwest Rail Line is planned to be completed by 2044, depending upon funding.,[107],
,These future transit plans, as well as the current Flatiron Flyer Bus Rapid Transit route, are part of ,FasTracks,, an RTD transit improvement plan funded by a 0.4% increase in the sales tax throughout the Denver metro area. ,RTD,, the developer of FasTracks, is partnering with the city of Boulder to plan a ,transit-oriented development, near Pearl and 33rd Streets in association with the proposed Boulder commuter rail station. The development is to feature the ,Boulder Railroad Depot,, already relocated to that site, which may be returned to a transit-related use.
,
,Cycling,[,edit,],
,Boulder, well known for its ,bicycle culture,, has hundreds of miles of bicycle-pedestrian paths, lanes, and routes that interconnect to create a renowned network of bikeways usable year-round. Boulder has 74 bike and pedestrian underpasses that facilitate safer and uninterrupted travel throughout much of the city. The city offers a route-finding website that allows users to map personalized bike routes around the city,,[108], and is one of five communities to have received a "",Platinum Bicycle Friendly Community,"" rating from the ,League of American Bicyclists,.,[109],
,The headquarters of the free and non-obligatory ,hospitality exchange network, for cyclists, ,Warm Showers,, is based in Boulder.,[110],
,In May 2011, ,B-cycle, bike-sharing opened in Boulder with 100 red bikes and 12 stations.,[111],
,
,Airport,[,edit,],
,Boulder Municipal Airport, is located 3 miles (4.8 km) northeast of central Boulder, is owned by the City of Boulder and is used exclusively for ,general aviation,, with most traffic consisting of single-engine airplanes and ,glider aircraft,.,[112],

,Netbooks, are small ,laptops,, with screen sizes between approximately 7 and 12 inches and low power consumption. They use either an SSD (,solid state disk,) or a HDD (,hard disk drive,) for storage, have up to 2 gigabytes of RAM (but often less), lack an ,optical disk drive,, and usually have ,USB,, ,Ethernet,, ,WiFi, and often ,Bluetooth, connectivity. The name emphasizes their use as portable Internet appliances.
,
,
,Netbook distributions,[,edit,],
,There are special ,Linux distributions,, called ,netbook distributions,, for these machines. All such distributions purport to be optimized for use with small, low-resolution displays. They tend to include a broad mix of ,VOIP, and web-focused tools, including proprietary applications rarely seen installed by default by mainstream desktop distributions,[,citation needed,],. For instance, ,Nokia, ,Maemo, and Asus' customized ,Xandros, both ship with ,Skype, and ,Adobe Flash, installed, and Ubuntu's Netbook Edition offers the option to do the same for OEMs.,[1],

,The ,Internal Revenue Service, (,IRS,) is the ,revenue service, for the ,United States federal government,, which is responsible for collecting ,U.S. federal taxes, and administering the ,Internal Revenue Code,, the main body of the federal statutory tax law. It is an agency of the ,Department of the Treasury, and led by the ,Commissioner of Internal Revenue,, who is appointed to a five-year term by the President of the United States. The duties of the IRS include providing tax assistance to taxpayers; pursuing and resolving instances of erroneous or fraudulent tax filings; and overseeing various benefits programs, including the ,Affordable Care Act,.,[5],
,
,Internal Revenue Service Building, on ,Constitution Avenue, in ,Washington, D.C.,
,IRS location sign on Constitution Avenue, Washington, D.C.,
,The IRS originates from the ,Commissioner of Internal Revenue,, a federal office created in 1862 to assess the nation's first ,income tax, to fund the ,American Civil War,. The temporary measure funded over a fifth of the Union's war expenses before being allowed to expire a decade later. In 1913, the ,Sixteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, was ratified, authorizing Congress to impose a tax on income and leading to the creation of the ,Bureau of Internal Revenue,. In 1953, the agency was renamed the Internal Revenue Service, and in subsequent decades underwent numerous reforms and reorganizations, most significantly in the 1990s.
,Since its establishment, the IRS has been responsible for collecting some of the revenue needed to fund the federal government with the rest being funded through the ,Federal Reserve, purchasing ,U.S. treasuries,.,[6], The IRS faces periodic ,controversy, and opposition over its methods, constitutionality, and the ,principle of taxation, generally. In recent years the agency has struggled with budget cuts and reduced morale.,[7], As of 2018,,[update], it saw a 15 percent reduction in its workforce, including a decline of more than 25 percent of its enforcement staff.,[8], Nevertheless, during the 2017 fiscal year, the agency processed more than 245 million tax returns.

,
,History,[,edit,],
,See also: ,Taxation history of the United States,
,American Civil War (1861–65),[,edit,],
,George S. Boutwell, was the first ,Commissioner of Internal Revenue, under President ,Abraham Lincoln,.,
,In July 1862, during the ,American Civil War,, ,President, ,Abraham Lincoln, and ,Congress, passed the ,Revenue Act of 1862,, creating the office of Commissioner of Internal Revenue and enacting a temporary ,income tax, to pay war expenses.
,The Revenue Act of 1862 was passed as an emergency and temporary war-time tax. It copied a relatively new British system of income taxation, instead of trade and property taxation. The first income tax was passed in 1862:
,
,The initial rate was 3% on income over $800, which exempted most wage-earners.,
,In 1862 the rate was 3% on income between $600 and $10,000, and 5% on income over $10,000.,
,By the end of the war, 10% of ,Union, households had paid some form of income tax, and the Union raised 21% of its war revenue through income taxes.,[9],
,
,Post Civil War, Reconstruction, and popular tax reform (1866–1913),[,edit,],
,After the Civil War, ,Reconstruction,, railroads, and transforming the North and South war machines towards peacetime required public funding. However, in 1872, seven years after the war, lawmakers allowed the temporary Civil War income tax to expire.
,Income taxes evolved, but in 1894 the ,Supreme Court, declared the Income Tax of 1894 unconstitutional in ,Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co.,, a decision that contradicted ,Hylton v. United States,.,[10], The federal government scrambled to raise money.,[11],
,In 1906, with the election of President ,Theodore Roosevelt,, and later his successor ,William Howard Taft,, the United States saw a ,populist, movement for tax reform. This movement culminated during then-candidate ,Woodrow Wilson,'s election of 1912 and in February 1913, the ratification of the ,Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution,:
,
,.mw-parser-output .templatequote{overflow:hidden;margin:1em 0;padding:0 32px}.mw-parser-output .templatequote .templatequotecite{line-height:1.5em;text-align:left;padding-left:1.6em;margin-top:0},The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes on incomes, from whatever source derived, without apportionment among the several States, and without regard to any census or enumeration.,
,This granted Congress the specific power to impose an income tax without regard to apportionment among the states by population. By February 1913, 36 states had ratified the change to the Constitution. It was further ratified by six more states by March. Of the 48 states at the time, 42 ratified it. Connecticut, Rhode Island, and Utah rejected the amendment; Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Florida did not take up the issue.,[12],
,
,Post 16th Amendment (1913–present),[,edit,],
,Though the constitutional amendment to allow the federal government to collect income taxes was proposed by ,President Taft, in 1909, the ,16th Amendment, was not ratified until 1913, just before the start of the ,First World War,. That same year, the first edition of the 1040 form was introduced. A copy of the 1913 form can be viewed online,[13],[14], and shows that only those with annual incomes of at least $3,000 (equivalent to $92,500 in 2023) were instructed to file an income tax return.
,In the first year after the ratification of the 16th Amendment, no taxes were collected. Instead, taxpayers simply completed the form and the IRS checked the form for accuracy. The IRS's workload jumped by ten-fold, triggering a massive restructuring. Professional tax collectors began to replace a system of ""patronage"" appointments. The IRS doubled its staff but was still processing 1917 returns in 1919.,[15],
,Income tax raised much of the money required to finance the war effort; in 1918 a new Revenue Act established a top tax rate of 77%.
,
,People filing tax forms in 1920,
,In 1919 the IRS was tasked with enforcement of laws relating to ,prohibition of alcohol sales and manufacture,; this was transferred to the jurisdiction of the Department of Justice in 1930. After repeal in 1933, the IRS resumed collection of taxes on beverage alcohol.,[16], The alcohol, tobacco and firearms activities of the bureau were segregated into the ,Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, in 1972.
,A ,new tax act was passed in 1942, as the United States entered the ,Second World War,. This act included a special wartime surcharge. The number of American citizens who paid income tax increased from about four million in 1939 to more than forty-two million by 1945.,[17],
,In 1952, after a series of politically damaging incidents of ,tax evasion, and bribery among its own employees, the Bureau of Internal Revenue was reorganized under a plan put forward by ,President Truman,, with the approval of Congress. The reorganization decentralized many functions to new district offices which replaced the collector's offices. Civil service directors were appointed to replace the politically appointed collectors of the Bureau of Internal Revenue. Not long after, the bureau was renamed the Internal Revenue Service.,[18],
,In 1954 the filing deadline was moved from March 15 to April 15.
,The ,Tax Reform Act of 1969, created the ,Alternative Minimum Tax,.
,By 1986, limited electronic filing of tax returns was possible.
,The ,Internal Revenue Service Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998, (""RRA 98"") changed the organization from geographically oriented to an organization based on four operating divisions.,[19], It added ""10 deadly sins"" that require immediate termination of IRS employees found to have committed certain misconduct.,[20],
,Enforcement activities declined. The ,IRS Oversight Board, noted that the decline in enforcement activities has ""rais[ed] questions about tax compliance and fairness to the vast majority of citizens who pay all their taxes"".,[21], In June 2012, the IRS Oversight Board recommended to Treasury a fiscal year 2014 budget of $13.074, ,billion for the Internal Revenue Service.,[22],
,On December 20, 2017, Congress passed the ,Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017,. It was signed into law by President Trump on December 22, 2017.
,In the three decades since 1991, the IRS had a substantial decrease in the number of employees per million residents, decreasing from 451 (in 1991) to 237 (in 2021).,[23],  A decrease of ,47.5 percent.
,
,Presidential tax returns (1973),[,edit,],
,From the 1950s through the 1970s, the IRS began using technology such as microfilm to keep and organize records. Access to this information proved controversial, when ,President Richard Nixon,'s tax returns were leaked to the public. His tax advisor, Edward L. Morgan, became the fourth law-enforcement official to be charged with a crime during ,Watergate,.,[24],
,John Requard Jr., accused of leaking the Nixon tax returns, collected delinquent taxes in the slums of Washington. In his words: ""We went after people for nickels and dimes, many of them poor and in many cases illiterate people who didn't know how to deal with a government agency."" Requard admitted that he saw the returns but denied that he leaked them.,[25],
,Reporter ,Jack White, of ,The Providence Journal, won the ,Pulitzer Prize, for reporting about Nixon's tax returns. Nixon, with a salary of $200,000, paid $792.81 in federal income tax in 1970 and $878.03 in 1971, with deductions of $571,000 for donating ""vice-presidential papers"".,[26], This was one of the reasons for his famous statement: ""Well, I'm not a crook. I've earned everything I've got.""
,So controversial was this leak, that most later US presidents released their tax returns (though sometimes only partially). These returns can be found online at the Tax History Project.,[27],
,
,Computerization (1959–present),[,edit,],
,By the end of the Second World War, the IRS was handling sixty million tax returns each year, using a combination of mechanical desk calculators, ,accounting machines,, and pencil and paper forms. In 1948 ,punch card, equipment was used. The first trial of a computer system for income tax processing was in 1955, when an ,IBM 650, installed at ,Kansas City, processed 1.1 million returns. The IRS was authorized to proceed with computerization in 1959 and purchased ,IBM 1401, and ,IBM 7070, systems for local and regional data processing centers. The ,Social Security number, was used for taxpayer identification starting in 1965. By 1967, all returns were processed by computer and punched card data entry was phased out.,[28],
,Information processing in the IRS systems of the late 1960s was in batch mode; microfilm records were updated weekly and distributed to regional centers for handling tax inquiries. A project to implement an interactive, realtime system, the ""Tax Administration System"", was launched, that would provide thousands of local interactive terminals at IRS offices. However, the ,General Accounting Office, prepared a report critical of the lack of protection of privacy in TAS, and the project was abandoned in 1978.,[28],
,In 1995, the IRS began to use the public Internet for electronic filing. Since the introduction of ,e-filing,, self-paced online tax services have flourished, augmenting the work of tax accountants, who were sometimes replaced.
,By 2002, more than a third of all tax returns were filed electronically. This led to a decline in the number of paper returns being processed each year.,[29], As a result, the IRS implemented a consolidation plan for its paper tax return processing centers, closing five of its ten processing centers between 2003 and 2011.,[30], The agency closed two more centers - one in 2019 and another in 2021 - as e-file use continued to expand.,[31],[32], E-filed tax returns accounted for 90% of all returns submitted during the 2021 filing season.,[33],
,In 2003, the IRS struck a deal with tax software vendors: The IRS would not develop online filing software and, in return, software vendors would provide free e-filing to most Americans.,[34], In 2009, 70% of filers qualified for free electronic filing of federal returns.,[35],
,According to an inspector general's report, released in November 2013, identity theft in the United States is blamed for $4, ,billion worth of fraudulent 2012 tax refunds by the IRS. Fraudulent claims were made with the use of stolen taxpayer identification and Social Security numbers, with returns sent to addresses both in the US and internationally. Following the release of the findings, the IRS stated that it resolved most of the identity theft cases of 2013 within 120 days, while the average time to resolve cases from the 2011/2012 tax period was 312 days.,[36],[37],
,In September 2014, IRS Commissioner ,John Koskinen, expressed concern over the organization's ability to handle ,Obamacare, and administer ,premium tax credits, that help people pay for health plans from the health law's insurance exchanges. It will also enforce the law's ,individual mandate,, which requires most Americans to hold health insurance.,[38], In January 2015, ,Fox News, obtained an email which predicted a messy tax season on several fronts. The email was sent by IRS Commissioner Koskinen to workers. Koskinen predicted the IRS would shut down operations for two days later that year which would result in unpaid ,furloughs, for employees and ,service cuts, for ,taxpayers,. Koskinen also said delays to ,IT, investments of more than $200, ,million may delay new taxpayer protections against ,identity theft,.,[37], Also in January 2015, the editorial board of ,The New York Times, called the IRS budget cuts penny-wise-and-pound-foolish, where for every dollar of cuts in the budget, six were lost in tax revenue.,[39],
,A 2020 Treasury Department audit found the IRS had improved its ,identity verification, system offerings for taxpayers, but was still behind in fully meeting digital identity requirements.,[40], The following year, the IRS announced a new login and ID verification process for several of its online tools, including general account access, Identity Protection (IP) ,PIN, setup, and payment plan applications.,[41],[42], As part of the agency's Identity, Credential, and Access Management (ICAM) initiative, the process included the use of third-party ,facial recognition technologies, to confirm taxpayer identities. The facial recognition requirement was dropped in 2022, however, following privacy concerns from government officials and the public.,[43], Alternative ID verification options have since been introduced with the goal of making IRS online tools accessible to more people.,[44],
,
,History of the IRS name,[,edit,],
,IRS and Department of the Treasury seal on lectern,
,As early as the year 1918, the Bureau of Internal Revenue began using the name ""Internal Revenue Service"" on at least one tax form.,[45], In 1953, the name change to the ""Internal Revenue Service"" was formalized in Treasury Decision 6038.,[46],
,
,Current organization,[,edit,],
,The 1980s saw a reorganization of the IRS. A bipartisan commission was created with several mandates, among them to increase customer service and improve collections.,[47], Congress later enacted the ,Internal Revenue Service Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998,, which mandated that the agency replace its geographic regional divisions with units that serve particular categories of taxpayers.,[48],
,As a result, the IRS now functions under four major operating divisions:
,
,Large Business and International (LB&I),
,Small Business/Self-Employed (SB/SE),
,Wage and Investment (W&I),
,Tax Exempt & Government Entities (TE/GE),
,The Large Business & International (LB&I) division was known as the Large and Mid-Size Business division prior to a name change on October 1, 2010.,[49],
,The IRS is ,headquartered, in ,Washington, D.C.,, and does most of its ,computer programming, in Maryland.,[50], It processes paper ,tax returns, sent by ,mail, and e-filed tax returns at three IRS center locations: Austin, Texas; Kansas City, Missouri; and Ogden, Utah.,[51],
,The IRS also operates computer centers in three locations: Detroit, Michigan; Martinsburg, West Virginia; and Memphis, Tennessee.,[52],
,
,Commissioner,[,edit,],
,Main article: ,Commissioner of Internal Revenue,
,The IRS is currently led by ,Daniel Werfel,, who became Commissioner of Internal Revenue on March 13, 2023.,[53], He succeeded ,Douglas O'Donnell,, who served as Acting Commissioner of Internal Revenue after ,Charles P. Rettig,'s term as Commissioner ended on November 12, 2022.,[54], There have been 50 commissioners of Internal Revenue and 28 acting commissioners since the agency's creation in 1862.,[55],
,From May 22, 2013, to December 23, 2013, senior official at the ,Office of Management and Budget, ,Daniel Werfel, was acting Commissioner of Internal Revenue.,[56], Werfel, who attended law school at the ,University of North Carolina, and attained a master's degree from ,Duke University,, prepared the government for a potential shutdown in 2011 by determining which services that would remain in existence.,[56],[57],
,No IRS commissioner has served more than five years and one month since Guy Helvering, who served 10 years until 1943.,[58], The most recent commissioner to serve the longest term was Doug Shulman, who was appointed by President ,George W. Bush, and served for five years.,[58],
,
,Deputy commissioners,[,edit,],
,The Commissioner of Internal Revenue is assisted by two deputy commissioners.
,The Deputy Commissioner for Operations Support reports directly to the Commissioner and oversees the IRS's integrated support functions, working to facilitate economy of scale efficiencies and better business practices. The Deputy also administers and provides executive leadership for customer service, processing, tax law enforcement and financial management operations. Additionally, the Deputy in this position assists and acts on behalf of the IRS Commissioner in directing, coordinating and controlling the policies, programs and activities of the IRS. This includes establishing tax administration policy and developing strategic issues and objectives for IRS strategic management.
,The Deputy Commissioner for Services and Enforcement reports directly to the Commissioner and oversees the four primary operating divisions responsible for the major customer segments and other taxpayer-facing functions. The Deputy Commissioner for Services and Enforcement serves as the IRS Commissioner's essential assistant acting on behalf of the commissioner in establishing and enforcing tax administration policy and upholding IRS's mission to provide America's taxpayers top-quality service by helping them understand and meet their tax responsibilities.
,
,Office of the Taxpayer Advocate,[,edit,],
,Main article: ,Office of the Taxpayer Advocate,
,The ,Office of the Taxpayer Advocate,, also called the Taxpayer Advocate Service, is an independent office within the IRS responsible for assisting taxpayers in resolving their problems with the IRS and identifying systemic problems that exist within the IRS.,[59], The current head of the organization, known as the ,United States Taxpayer Advocate,, is Erin M. Collins.,[60],
,
,Independent Office of Appeals,[,edit,],

,For fiscal year 2009, the U.S. Congress appropriated spending of approximately $12.624, ,billion of ""discretionary budget authority"" to operate the Department of the Treasury, of which $11.522, ,billion was allocated to the IRS. The projected estimate of the budget for the IRS for fiscal year 2011 was $12.633, ,billion.,[69], By contrast, during Fiscal Year (FY) 2006, the IRS collected more than $2.2, ,trillion in tax (net of refunds), about 44 percent of which was attributable to the individual income tax. This is partially due to the nature of the individual income tax category, containing taxes collected from working class, small business, self-employed, and capital gains. The top 5% of income earners pay 38.284% of the federal tax collected.,[70],[71],
,As of 2007, the agency estimates that the United States Treasury is owed $354, ,billion more than the amount the IRS collects.,[72], This is known as the tax gap.,[73],
,The gross tax gap is the amount of true tax liability that is not paid voluntarily and timely. For years 2008–2010, the estimated gross tax gap was $458, ,billion. The net tax gap is the gross tax gap less tax that will be subsequently collected, either paid voluntarily or as the result of IRS administrative and enforcement activities; it is the portion of the gross tax gap that will not be paid. It is estimated that $52, ,billion of the gross tax gap was eventually collected resulting in a net tax gap of $406, ,billion.,[74],
,In 2011, 234 million tax returns were filed allowing the IRS to collect $2.4, ,trillion out of which $384, ,billion were attributed to mistake or ,fraud,.,[75],
,
,Outsourcing collection and tax-assistance,[,edit,],
,In September 2006, the IRS started to outsource the collection of taxpayers debts to private debt collection agencies. Opponents to this change note that the IRS will be handing over personal information to these debt collection agencies, who are being paid between 29% and 39% of the amount collected. Opponents are also worried about the agencies' being paid on percent collected, because it will encourage the collectors to use pressure tactics to collect the maximum amount. IRS spokesman Terry Lemons responds to these critics saying the new system ""is a sound, balanced program that respects taxpayers' rights and taxpayer privacy"". Other state and local agencies also use private collection agencies.,[76],
,In March 2009, the IRS announced that it would no longer outsource the collection of taxpayers debts to private debt collection agencies. The IRS decided not to renew contracts to private debt collection agencies and began a hiring program at its call sites and processing centers across the country to bring on more personnel to process collections internally from taxpayers.,[77], As of October 2009, the IRS has ceased using private debt collection agencies.
,In September 2009, after ,undercover exposé videos, of questionable activities by staff of one of the IRS's volunteer tax-assistance organizations were made public, the IRS removed ,ACORN, from its volunteer tax-assistance program.,[78],

,The IRS publishes ,tax forms, which taxpayers are required to choose from and use for calculating and reporting their federal tax obligations. The IRS also publishes a number of forms for its own internal operations, such as Forms 3471 and 4228 (which are used during the initial processing of income tax returns).
,In addition to collection of revenue and pursuing tax cheaters, the IRS issues administrative rulings such as ,revenue rulings, and ,private letter rulings,. In addition, the Service publishes the ,Internal Revenue Bulletin, containing the various IRS pronouncements.,[79], The controlling authority of regulations and revenue rulings allows taxpayers to rely on them. A letter ruling is good for the taxpayer to whom it is issued and gives some explanation of the Service's position on a particular tax issue.,[80], Additionally, a letter ruling reasonably relied upon by a taxpayer allows for the waiver of penalties for underpayment of tax.
,As is the case with all administrative pronouncements, taxpayers sometimes litigate the validity of the pronouncements, and courts sometimes determine a particular rule to be invalid where the agency has exceeded its authority. The IRS also issues formal pronouncements called Revenue Procedures. These guide taxpayers through different processes, such as correcting prior tax errors. The IRS's own internal operations manual is the ,Internal Revenue Manual,, which describes the clerical procedures for processing and auditing tax returns for almost any circumstance. For example, the Internal Revenue Manual includes special procedures for processing tax returns from the President and ,Vice President of the United States,.,[80],
,In addition to the foregoing procedures, the IRS also engages in formal rulemaking in order to provide its own formal interpretation of a statute, or when the statute itself directs that the ,Secretary of the Treasury, shall provide for such rulemaking.  The IRS initiates the formal regulation process by publishing a ,notice of proposed rulemaking, (NPRM) in the ,Federal Register, which announces the proposed regulation, the date of the in-person hearing, and the process for interested parties to have their views heard either in person at the hearing in Washington, D.C., or by mail. Following the statutory period provided in the ,Administrative Procedure Act, the Service decides on the final regulations ""as is"", or as reflecting changes, or sometimes withdraws the proposed regulations. Generally, taxpayers may rely on proposed regulations until final regulations become effective. For example, human resource professionals are relying on the October 4, 2005, Proposed Regulations,[81], (citation 70 ,F.R., 57930–57984),[82], for the Section 409A on deferred compensation (the so-called ,Enron, rules on deferred compensation to add teeth to the old rules) because regulations have not been finalized.
,The IRS oversaw the Homebuyer Credit and First Time Homebuyer Credit programs instituted by the federal government from 2008 to 2010. Those programs provided United States citizens with money toward the purchase of homes, regardless of income tax filings.,[83],
,
,Labor union,[,edit,],
,Further information: ,Labor unions in the United States,
,Most non-supervisory employees at the IRS are represented by a labor union. The exclusive labor union at the IRS is the ,National Treasury Employees Union, (NTEU). Employees are not required to join the union or pay dues. The IRS and NTEU have a national ,collective bargaining agreement,.,[84],
,In pursuing administrative remedies against the IRS for certain unfair or illegal personnel actions, under federal law an IRS employee may choose only one of the three forums below:
,
,NTEU, or,
,United States Merit Systems Protection Board, (MSPB), or,
,United States Office of Special Counsel, (OSC).,[85],
,Employees are also required to report certain misconduct to ,TIGTA,. Federal law prohibits reprisal or retaliation against an employee who reports wrongdoing.,[86],[87],[88],
,
,Controversies,[,edit,],
,See also: ,List of allegations of misuse of the Internal Revenue Service,
,The IRS has been accused of abusive behavior on multiple occasions.,[89],[90],[91],[92], Testimony was given before a Senate subcommittee that focused on cases of overly aggressive IRS collection tactics in considering a need for legislation to give taxpayers greater protection in disputes with the agency.
,Congress passed the ,Taxpayer Bill of Rights III, on July 22, 1998, which shifted the ,burden of proof, from the taxpayer to the IRS in certain limited situations. The IRS retains the legal authority to enforce liens and seize assets without obtaining judgment in court.,[93],
,In 2002, the IRS accused James and Pamela Moran, as well as several others, of conspiracy, filing false tax returns and mail fraud as part of the Anderson Ark investment scheme. The Morans were eventually acquitted, and their attorney stated that the government should have realized that the couple was merely duped by those running the scheme.,[94],
,In 2004, the law licenses of two former IRS lawyers were suspended after a federal court ruled that they defrauded the courts so the IRS could win a sum in tax shelter cases.,[95],
,In 2013, the Internal Revenue Service became embroiled in a ,political scandal, in which it was discovered that the agency subjected ,conservative, or conservative-sounding groups filing for tax-exempt status to extra scrutiny,,[96], though liberal groups were also targeted.,[97],
,On September 5, 2014, 16 months after the scandal first erupted, a Senate Subcommittee released a report that confirmed that Internal Revenue Service used inappropriate criteria to target Tea Party groups, but found no evidence of political bias.,[98], The chairman of the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations confirmed that while the actions were ""inappropriate, intrusive, and burdensome"", the Democrats have often experienced similar treatment.,[99], Republicans noted that 83% of the groups being held up by the IRS were right-leaning; and the Subcommittee Minority staff, which did not join the Majority staff report, filed a dissenting report entitled, ""IRS Targeting Tea Party Groups"".,[100],
,On May 25, 2015, the agency announced that over several months criminals had accessed the private tax information of more than 100,000 taxpayers and stolen about $50, ,million in fraudulent returns.,[101], By providing Social Security numbers and other information obtained from prior computer crimes, the criminals were able to use the IRS's online ""Get Transcript"" function to have the IRS provide them with the tax returns and other private information of American tax filers.,[102], On August 17, 2015, IRS disclosed that the breach had compromised an additional 220,000 taxpayer records.,[103], On February 27, 2016, the IRS disclosed that more than 700,000 Social Security numbers and other sensitive information had been stolen.,[104],[105],[106],
,The Internal Revenue Service has been the subject of frequent criticism by many elected officials and candidates for political office, including some who have called to abolish the IRS. Among them were ,Ted Cruz,, ,Rand Paul,, ,Ben Carson,, ,Mike Huckabee,, and ,Richard Lugar,.,[107], In 1998, a Republican congressman introduced a bill to repeal the Internal Revenue Code by 2002.,[108], In 2016, The ,Republican Study Committee,, which counts over two-thirds of House of Representatives Republicans as its members, called for ""the complete elimination of the IRS"", and Republican Representative ,Rob Woodall, of Georgia has introduced a bill every year since he entered Congress in 2011 to eliminate income taxes and abolish the IRS.,[109],
,In 2022, Representative ,Matt Gaetz, of Florida introduced a bill to disarm the IRS after the agency had drawn public attention for a $700,000 purchase of ammunition.,[110],[111],
,The IRS has been criticized for its reliance on ,legacy software,. Systems such as the ,Individual Master File, are more than 50 years old and have been identified by the ,Government Accountability Office, as ""facing significant risks due to their reliance on legacy programming languages, outdated hardware, and a shortage of human resources with critical skills"".,[112],

,The ,Detroit Lions, are a professional ,American football, team based in ,Detroit,, ,Michigan,.  The Lions compete in the ,National Football League, (NFL) as a member of the ,North Divison, of the ,National Football Conference, (NFC). The franchise was founded in ,Portsmouth, Ohio,, as the ,Portsmouth Spartans, and joined the NFL on July 12, 1930.,[6], After being purchased by ,George A. Richards, in 1934, the franchise was ,relocated, to Detroit and renamed to the Detroit Lions in reference to the city's ,Major League Baseball, franchise, the ,Detroit Tigers,.,[7],[8], The team plays its home games at ,Ford Field, in ,Downtown Detroit,.,[9],
,Starting with the ,1938 NFL season,, the NFL instituted an All-Star Game that pitted the league's championship team against a team made up of the best players from the remaining teams.,[10], Five of these ,exhibition games, were played, with the last occurring after the ,1942 NFL season, before the NFL reduced the number of teams and games in the season due to players serving in ,World War II,.,[11],[12], The first official ,Pro Bowl, occurred in 1951 following the ,1950 NFL season,.,[13], From the 1950 season until the ,1969 season,, the exhibition game was played between teams representing the ,Eastern and Western Conferences, of the NFL.,[14], After the ,American Football League, (AFL) ,merged with the NFL, in 1970, the game was played between teams representing the NFC and the ,American Football Conference, (AFC). The conference team format remained until 2014 when the NFL shifted to a fantasy football format with teams selected by captains from the full pool of Pro Bowl selectees. This format only lasted for three seasons before it reverted back to the conference team format from the ,2016, to ,2021 NFL seasons,;,[13], this period included the cancellation of the ,2021 Pro Bowl, due to the ,COVID-19 pandemic, (teams were still selected and players were still recognized as Pro Bowl selectees).,[15], Starting with the ,2023 Pro Bowl, after the ,2022 NFL season,, the NFL again changed the format; instead of playing an exhibition game, the Pro Bowl was converted to series of skill competitions that culminated in a non-contact ,flag football, game.,[16],
,Pro Bowl selections are made by a cumulative vote by three groups that hold equal weight: coaches, players, and fans.,[13], Based on the vote results, each team is filled out based on generic offense, defense, and special teams.,[17], Before the institution of the Pro Bowl Games in 2023, the players with the most votes were named starters, while the remainder of the selectees were reserves.,[18], If a Pro Bowl selectee is unable to participate in the Pro Bowl, either due to health reasons or the fact they are playing in the ,Super Bowl, right after the Pro Bowl, alternates are named in the players' place. These players are still considered official Pro Bowl selectees.,[19], The coaching staffs for each team have been selected in various ways, with the common option being the coaching staffs of the team with the best record in each conference who were not going to the Super Bowl given the honors.,[20], With the onset of the Pro Bowl Games, the NFL now selects the coaching staffs for the flag football game.,[21], Players for each team are paid for their participation, with a higher sum going to the winning team.,[22], Throughout the life of the Pro Bowl, awards have been given out to recognize the best player or players of the game. From 2016 to 2022, an award was given to an offensive and defensive most valuable player (MVP).,[11],
,The Lions have had representatives at the Pro Bowl every year since 1950 except for nine seasons. The Lions first selections in the ,inaugural Pro Bowl in 1951, were ,Cloyce Box,, ,Lou Creekmur,, ,Don Doll,, ,Thurman McGraw,, and ,Doak Walker,.,[23], Four Lions have been given a Pro Bowl MVP award.,[11], Linebacker ,Joe Schmidt, and running back ,Barry Sanders, are tied for the team record for most Pro Bowl selections with 10, while ,Yale Lary, (nine selections), and Lou Creekmur (eight selections) round out the top four.,[1], Sanders was the first player to play at least 10 seasons in the NFL and be selected to the Pro Bowl in each season they played.,[24],  The most recent Pro Bowl selections for the Lions were ,Jahmyr Gibbs,, ,Aidan Hutchinson,, ,Sam LaPorta,, ,Frank Ragnow,, ,Jalen Reeves-Maybin,, ,Penei Sewell,, and ,Amon-Ra St. Brown, for the ,2024 Pro Bowl Games,.,[25],

,^ ,a, ,b, ,Debian releases are officially supported for 1 year after the ,subsequent, release, with releases being approximately 2 years apart. The Debian LTS Project provides community based support extending the complete support period to 5 years.,

,
,
,Technical,[,edit,],
,The table below shows the default file system, but many Linux distributions support some or all of ,ext2,, ,ext3,, ,ext4,, ,Btrfs,, ,ReiserFS,, ,Reiser4,, ,JFS,, ,XFS,, ,GFS2,, ,OCFS2,, and ,NILFS,. It is possible to install Linux onto most of these file systems. The ext file systems, namely ext2, ext3, and ext4 are based on the original Linux file system.
,File systems have been developed by companies to meet their specific needs, by hobbyists, or adapted from ,Unix,, Microsoft Windows, and other operating systems. Linux has full support for XFS and JFS, ,FAT, (the ,DOS, file system), and ,HFS,, the main file system for the ,Macintosh,. Support for Microsoft ,Windows NT,'s ,NTFS, file system has been developed and is now comparable with other native Unix file systems. CDs, DVDs, and Blu-ray discs' ,ISO 9660, and ,Universal Disk Format, (UDF) are supported.
,Unlike other operating systems, Linux and Unix allow any file system regardless of the medium it is stored on, whether that medium is a magnetic disk, an optical disk (CD, DVD, etc.), a USB flash memory key, or even contained within a file located on another file system. Similarly, many C compilers (mainly ,GNU Compiler Collection, (GCC)), init systems (mainly ,sysvinit,), desktop environments and window managers are widely supported.

,Package management and installation,[,edit,],
,Information on features in the distributions. Package numbers are only approximate. Some distributions like Debian tend to separate tools into different packages – usually stable release, development release, documentation and debug. Also counting the source package number varies. For debian and rpm based entries it is just the base to produce binary packages, so the total number of packages is the number of binary packages. For Arch based entries, it is additional.

Dieser Artikel erläutert das Lizenzkonzept, das nicht mit dem Lizenzkonzept ,Freeware, zu verwechseln ist.,
,
,Concept-Map, rund um Freie Software,
,Freie Software, (,freiheitsgewährende Software,, ,englisch, ,free software, oder auch ,libre software,) bezeichnet ,Software,, die die ,Freiheit, von Computernutzern in den Mittelpunkt stellt. Freie Software wird dadurch definiert, dass ein Nutzer mit dem Empfang,[Anm. 1], der Software die Nutzungsrechte mitempfängt und diese ihm nicht vorenthalten oder beschränkt werden.,[1],[2],[3],[4],
,Insbesondere bedeutet es,
,
,die Freiheit der ,Kontrolle, über die Software (und zwar uneingeschränkte Freiheit der Kontrolle und ,Unabhängigkeit, durch Erhalt des genauen ,Quellcodes,, um Analysen und Änderungen der Software zu erlauben,[Anm. 2],),,
,die soziale Freiheit der ,Kollaboration,, um aktiv mit beliebigen anderen Nutzern und Entwicklern kooperieren zu können (die Software darf kopiert und weitergegeben werden,,[Anm. 3], im Original oder mit Veränderung).,
,Man darf hinsichtlich der Software wahlweise ,kommerzielle, Tätigkeiten anbieten (Softwareanpassungen, Wartungsverträge, Support, Service- und Garantieleistungen usw.).,[5], Gewünschte Analyse und Änderungen (siehe Freiheit der Kontrolle) darf wegen gewährter Kollaboration von jedem – auch unabhängigen Dritten seiner eigenen Wahl – durchgeführt werden.
,Durch diese Freiheitsrechte wird es dem Nutzer erlaubt, ,Eigenkontrolle, und ,Privatsphäre,[6], über die Software und die eigene Datenverarbeitung zu haben oder Teil einer (öffentlichen oder eigenen,[Anm. 4],) Gruppe von Nutzern ,(Gemeinschaft), zu werden, welche die Software kontrollieren (Kollaboration ist möglich) und für sich nutzen.
,Dies steht im Gegensatz zu ,proprietärer Software,, bei der die Entwickler und Distributoren der Software den Endnutzern die genannten Freiheitsrechte explizit entziehen – so die Definition der ,Free Software Foundation, (FSF) –, beispielsweise durch absichtliche Nicht-Auslieferung von ,Quelltext, oder Verbote und Einschränkungen per ,Vertragsregelungen, oder ,Geheimhaltungsvertrag,.

,Offizielles Logo der ,FSF,
,Die vier Freiheiten,[,Bearbeiten, | ,Quelltext bearbeiten,],
,Richard Stallman, (2014), FSF-Gründer,
,Die 1985 von ,Richard Stallman, gegründete ,Free Software Foundation, (FSF) definiert Software als ,Freie Software,, wenn dem Empfänger per Lizenz folgende Freiheiten eingeräumt werden:,[7],
,
,Freiheit 0:, Die Freiheit, das Programm auszuführen, wie man möchte, für jeden Zweck.,
,Freiheit 1:, Die Freiheit, die Funktionsweise des Programms zu untersuchen und eigenen Bedürfnissen der Datenverarbeitung anzupassen.,*,
,Freiheit 2:, Die Freiheit, das Programm weiterzuverbreiten und damit seinen Mitmenschen zu helfen.,
,Freiheit 3:, Die Freiheit, das Programm zu verbessern und diese Verbesserungen der Öffentlichkeit freizugeben, damit die gesamte Gemeinschaft davon profitiert.,*,
,*, Für die Freiheiten 1 und 3 ist der Zugang zum Quelltext Voraussetzung, da sonst das Verändern eines ,Programms, schwierig bis unmöglich ist.
,Für weitere Informationen dazu siehe den Abschnitt ,Definition,.
,
,Wurzeln,[,Bearbeiten, | ,Quelltext bearbeiten,],
,Die ,Freie-Software-Bewegung, ist aus der ,Hacker,-Gemeinschaft hervorgegangen.,[8],[9],[10], Deren Freiheitsvision,[11], manifestiert sich in dem seit September 1983 existierenden ,GNU-Projekt,, der Freie-Software- und der 15 Jahre später entstandenen ,Open-Source-Bewegung,. Ein Merkmal eines Hackers ist nicht die Aktivität selbst, sondern die Art wie sie durchgeführt wird. Jemand der beispielsweise für ein Freie-Software-Projekt entwickelt, ist nicht automatisch ein Hacker, aber die Hackergemeinschaft ist eng verknüpft mit diesen Bewegungen. Innerhalb der frühen Hackergemeinschaft der 1960er- und 1970er-Jahre war es an akademischen US-Einrichtungen wie ,MIT,, ,Stanford,, ,Berkeley, und ,Carnegie Mellon,, selbstverständlich, Quellcodes offenzulegen und eigene Softwareverbesserungen mit anderen Programmierern zu teilen. Software wurde damals als Beigabe zu der (teuren) Hardware betrachtet. Ende der 1970er und Anfang der 1980er Jahre fingen IT-Unternehmen an, Software zu kommerzialisieren und den Quelltext geheim zu halten. Richard Stallman ist ein prominenter Hacker, der wesentliche Beiträge zum Selbstverständnis der ,akademischen Hackerkultur, geleistet hat, unter anderem indem er dieser Entwicklung etwas entgegenstellte.,[8],[9],
,Bis in die 1980er Jahre gab es Freie Software als ,Public-domain,-Software.,[12], Daneben wurde Software frei als gedruckter Quelltext in Computermagazinen und Büchern verbreitet.,[13], Die Hackergemeinschaft und das intellektuelle Klima rund um den ,„AI“-Rechner des MIT, inspirierten Richard Stallman maßgeblich zur Schaffung des GNU-Projekts.,[10], Das hatte zunächst die Erstellung eines freien Betriebssystems zum Ziel. 1985 folgte die Gründung der FSF, einer Stiftung zur Förderung derartiger Projekte, die im Februar 1986 die erste ,Definition der Freien Software, veröffentlichte, wobei „frei“ die ,Freiheiten für die Gesellschaft, meint, die ein ,derart lizenziertes Produkt bietet,.
,Für weitere Informationen dazu siehe die Abschnitte ,„Entwicklungen im Vorfeld“, und ,„Die Entstehung Freier Software“,.
,
,Abgrenzung,[,Bearbeiten, | ,Quelltext bearbeiten,],
,Freeware,[,Bearbeiten, | ,Quelltext bearbeiten,],
,Free-Beer,-Verkauf beim Isummit 2008 illustriert ,Free as in Freedom, not free as in free beer,: Rezept und Label des Biers sind unter der ,CC-BY-SA,, also frei wie in Freiheit, es ist aber nicht kostenlos wie ,Freibier,, da es für 500 ,Yen, verkauft wird.,[14],
,→ ,Hauptartikel,: ,Freeware,
,Das englische Wort ,free, hat zwei unterschiedliche Bedeutungen und steht in dem seit 1982 gebräuchlichen Begriff ,Freeware, für „kostenfrei“ (genauer für „kostenlose Software“); in ,Freie Software, (englisch ,Free Software,) steht es für „Freiheit“ (genauer für „freiheitsgewährende Software“). Englischsprachige Aktivisten machen die Unterscheidung mit ,free as in free beer, („frei wie ,Freibier,“) und ,Free as in Freedom, („frei wie in Freiheit“) deutlich.
,Freeware räumt dem Benutzer nicht die von der Free Software Foundation ,aufgelisteten Freiheiten, ein, sondern die der individuellen Lizenzvereinbarung mit dem Urheber. Daher gilt sie als „unfreie“ Software.
,Freie Software enthält hingegen die genannten Freiheiten und kann, ,muss aber nicht, kostenlos sein.
,
,Open Source,[,Bearbeiten, | ,Quelltext bearbeiten,],
,→ ,Hauptartikel,: ,Open Source,
,Der Begriff ,Open Source, (zu deutsch „quelloffen“) wurde 1998 von den Gründern der ,Open Source Initiative, (OSI) eingeführt: ,Eric S. Raymond,, ,Bruce Perens, und ,Tim O’Reilly,. Sie wollten den pragmatischeren Ansatz derartiger Software in den Mittelpunkt stellen, statt auf eine (aus ihrer Sicht) möglicherweise abschreckend wirkende, moralisch aufgeladene und polarisierende Freie-Software-Idee zu setzen.,[15],[16], Quelloffene Software wird von ihnen als vorteilhaftes Entwicklungsmodell beschrieben, wobei die Frage, ob Software quelloffen sein sollte, dort eine rein praktische und keine ethische Frage ist.
,Mit der Betonung der Überlegenheit des Entwicklungsprozesses gibt die OSI eher die Sichtweise der Entwickler wieder,,[17], während die FSF auf die Sicht der Anwender fokussiert.,[18], Die FSF begreift unfreie Software als gesellschaftliches Problem. In ihren Augen ist die Entscheidung für oder gegen Freie Software deshalb primär eine ethische und soziale Entscheidung; der praktische Nutzen ist sekundär. Da in der Darstellung der OSI die Freiheit, die Freie Software den Benutzern gibt, nicht erwähnt wird, wirft die FSF der OSI eine Ablenkung von den wesentlichen Punkten vor.,[19],
,Diese zwei unterschiedlichen Bewegungen mit unterschiedlichen Sichtweisen verbindet die gemeinsame Wertschätzung für quelloffenen Code und das Ziel des Aufbaus eines freien Softwareökosystems, was in zahlreichen Projekten mündet, in denen sie zusammenarbeiten. Alternative Kompromissbezeichnungen wie „Free and open source software“ (FOSS) oder „,Free/Libre Open Source Software,“ (FLOSS), die von Anhängern beider Positionen akzeptiert werden, sollen die Gemeinsamkeiten betonen.
,Für weitere Informationen dazu siehe den Abschnitt ,„Vergleich mit der Open-Source-Definition“,.
,
,Halbfreie Software,[,Bearbeiten, | ,Quelltext bearbeiten,],
,→ ,Hauptartikel,: ,Halbfreie Software,
,Wegen Bedenken bezüglich kommerzieller Ausnutzung oder amoralischem Gebrauch der eigenen Software gab und gibt es Bestrebungen, nicht alle Freiheiten aus der Definition freier Software in ihrer Lizenz uneingeschränkt zu gewähren. Werden die von der FSF aufgelisteten Freiheiten um die kommerzielle Weiterverbreitung vermindert (aber die sonstigen unverändert beibehalten), wurde dies von der FSF bis 2011 ablehnend als ,halbfreie Software, (englisch ,semi-free software,) bezeichnet.
,Seit 2012 nimmt die FSF diese Unterscheidung nicht mehr vor und zählt Software mit derart angepassten Lizenzen zur „unfreien“ Software.,[20],
,
,Unfreie Software (proprietär),[,Bearbeiten, | ,Quelltext bearbeiten,],
,→ ,Hauptartikel,: ,proprietär,
,Sind eine oder mehrere Bedingungen der von der FSF aufgelisteten Freiheiten nicht erfüllt, wird die Software als proprietär oder „unfrei“ (im Sinne fehlender Freiheiten) bezeichnet.
,
,Freie Hardware,[,Bearbeiten, | ,Quelltext bearbeiten,],
,→ ,Hauptartikel,: ,Freie Hardware,
,Freie Hardware, (,englisch, ,free hardware,, auch bezeichnet als ,open hardware, oder ,open source hardware,) steht der Freie-Software- und Open-Source-Bewegung nahe bzw. geht auf diese zurück. Dabei handelt es sich um ,Hardware,, die nach ,freien, ,Bauplänen, hergestellt wird.
,
,Definition,[,Bearbeiten, | ,Quelltext bearbeiten,],
,Die auf Februar 1986 datierte früheste bekannte Veröffentlichung der Definition stammt von der (jetzt nicht mehr weitergeführten) ,GNU's Bulletin Publication, der FSF.,[21], Die Quelle für dieses Dokument ist im Philosophieabschnitt der Webseite des ,GNU-Projekts, zu finden. Die Definition bezog sich zunächst auf zwei Punkte:,[21],
,
,
,
,„The word ‘free’ in our name does not refer to price; it refers to freedom.
,
,First the freedom to copy a program and redistribute it to your neighbors, so that they can use it as well as you.,
,Second, the freedom to change a program, so that you can control it instead of it controlling you; for this, the source code must be made available to you.“,
,
,
,„Das Wort ‚free‘ in unserem Namen bezieht sich nicht auf den Preis; es bezieht sich auf Freiheit.

,Erstens, die Freiheit, ein Programm zu kopieren und an eure Nachbarn weiterzugeben, sodass sie das Programm ebenso wie ihr nutzen können.,
,Zweitens, die Freiheit, ein Programm abzuändern, sodass ihr das Programm beherrscht und nicht das Programm euch; zu diesem Zwecke muss euch der Quelltext verfügbar gemacht sein.“,
,– ,FSF, 1986,
,Im Jahr 1996 wurde Freie Software auf der Webseite gnu.org definiert, indem man sich auf die „drei Ebenen von Freiheit“ bezog und explizit noch hinzufügte, dass man auch die Freiheit haben müsse, die Software studieren zu können. Das kann auch in der älteren Zweipunktedefinition als Teil der Freiheit, das Programm verändern zu können, herausgelesen werden,,[22],[23], ist dort aber nicht so deutlich hervorgehoben. Später mied Stallman das Wort „Ebene“, weil man alle Freiheiten brauche und das Wort dafür etwas irreführend sei.
,Schlussendlich wurde noch eine Freiheit hinzugefügt, die explizit sagt, dass Nutzer die Möglichkeit haben sollten, das Programm auszuführen, wie er möchte, für jeden Zweck. Die bestehenden Freiheiten wurden bereits von eins bis drei nummeriert, aber diese Freiheit sollte vor den anderen kommen; darum wurde sie ergänzt als „Freiheit 0“.,[24],
,Die moderne Definition definiert Freie Software durch die bereits ,weiter oben aufgeführten vier Freiheiten,.,[25], Zusammengefasst definiert sie Freie Software als Software, die Endnutzern die Freiheiten der Nutzung, des Überprüfens/Studierens, des Teilens und des Modifizierens der Software gewährleistet.
,Seit April 2008 wird die Definition in 39 Sprachen auf der FSF Webseite veröffentlicht.,[26], Ebenfalls veröffentlicht die FSF auf ihrer Webseite eine Liste von Lizenzen, die den Anforderungen an diese Definition gerecht werden.

,Vergleich mit der Open-Source-Definition,[,Bearbeiten, | ,Quelltext bearbeiten,],
,→ ,Hauptartikel,: ,Definition von Open Source, und ,Debian Free Software Guidelines,
,Die Unterschiede zur Freien Software wurden bereits ,weiter oben im Abschnitt zur Abgrenzung zur ,Open-Source-Software, verdeutlicht. Demgegenüber gibt es auch viele Gemeinsamkeiten; so wurden beispielsweise die „Debian Free Software Guidelines“ von der ,Open Source Initiative, (OSI), unter dem Namen „Open Source Definition“ verwendet; die einzige Änderung ist die Ersetzung des Begriffs ,Freie Software, durch ,Open-Source-Software,. Die FSF kommentierte dazu folgendes:
,
,
,
,„Der Begriff Open-Source-Software wird von einigen benutzt, um mehr oder weniger die gleiche Kategorie wie Freie Software zu meinen. Es ist nicht genau die gleiche Softwarekategorie: einige Lizenzen wurden [von der OSI] akzeptiert, die wir als zu restriktiv betrachten, und es gibt Freie Software-Lizenzen, die [von der OSI] nicht akzeptiert wurden. Jedoch sind die Unterschiede in der Erweiterung der Kategorie klein:
,
,sämtliche Freie Software ist öffentlich zugänglicher Quellcode, und sämtliche Open-Source-Software ist beinahe frei.“,

,Verschiedene Blickwinkel auf Freie Software,[,Bearbeiten, | ,Quelltext bearbeiten,],
,Freiheit und Rechte,[,Bearbeiten, | ,Quelltext bearbeiten,],
,→ ,Hauptartikel,: ,Freie Inhalte, und ,Freie Lizenz,
,Die genannten Ziele von Freier Software, die Freiheit in der Kontrolle der eigenen Datenverarbeitung und die Kooperation, werden durch die Gewährung folgender Rechte erreicht: die Nutzer dürfen Freie Software ausführen, kopieren, verbreiten, untersuchen, ändern und verbessern;,[2],[3], diese Freiheiten werden gewährt und nicht (wie bei proprietärer Software) entzogen. Entscheidend ist daher nicht die Vermeidung von Kosten, sondern die Freiheiten der Endnutzer. So wird das Kontrollrecht über die Software dadurch garantiert, dass ein Nutzer von Freier Software immer den dazugehörigen Quellcode zur Verfügung hat oder diesen zumindest nachträglich beziehen kann (was untersuchen und modifizieren ermöglicht),- und dadurch, dass ein Nutzer durch gewährte Kooperation dies wahlweise von Anderen durchführen lassen kann.
,Freie Software ist an ihrer Lizenz erkennbar. Dazu gehört die ,GNU General Public License, und andere freie Softwarelizenzen.,[29], Ein soziales und ethisches Grundprinzip hinter den verfochtenen Rechten an und mit Freier Software ist, dass ihre Entwickler die Freiheit sowie die Gemeinschaft der Endnutzer schätzen und respektieren, weil die Nutzungsbedingungen von Freier Software es Anwendern wie Entwicklern gleichermaßen ermöglichen, ein Umfeld der Unabhängigkeit, Gemeinschaft, Zusammenarbeit, Ethik, Solidarität und des Austauschs zu schaffen und zu gestalten.,[30],[31],[32],[33],[34],[35],
,Der Begriff „Freie Software“ und dessen genaue Definition,[7], sowie die Unterscheidung zu proprietärer Software,[36], so wie der spezifische Freiheitsgedanke gehen entscheidend zurück auf den Beginn des ,GNU-Projekts, um Programmierer-Aktivisten wie ,Richard Stallman, und die damit verbundene Gründung der ,Free Software Foundation, (FSF) im Jahr 1985.
,Die in Bezug auf Anspruch und Zielsetzungen zwar eng verwandte, der Wahl ihrer Mittel und Wege dorthin nach nicht identische und eigenständige ,Open-Source-Bewegung, entstand erst später (1998) und in einem anderen personellen Umfeld.,[37],[38], Der Unterschied zwischen den Ansätzen Freie Software und Open Source liegt vor allem in der jeweiligen Gewichtung prinzipiell gemeinsam vertretener Werte: Im Sinne von Open Source liegt das Hauptaugenmerk beim praktischen Nutzen und den Entwicklungsmethoden,,[17], während der Fokus der Freie-Software-Gemeinschaft auf den ethischen, sozialen und politischen Implikationen liegt.,[18],
,Zu den Nutzern Freier Software gehören Privatnutzer, Unternehmen und öffentliche Einrichtungen, wie Regierungen (vor allem auf Grund der Unabhängigkeit, Freiheit und Kontrolle der eigenen Datenverarbeitung),,[39], Forschungszentren (,CERN,), Universitäten, der ,New York Stock Exchange,, ,Wikipedia,, das ,Verteidigungsministerium der Vereinigten Staaten,.,[40],
,Der Fokus von ,Freier Software, ist also die Freiheit des Anwenders zu teilen, zu kopieren und zu modifizieren und steht den üblichen Beschränkungen ,proprietärer Software, („unfreie Software“ – im Sinne fehlender Freiheiten),[41], entgegen: Bei proprietärer Software versuchen Entwickler, die Endnutzer und den Endverbraucher-Markt zu kontrollieren und zu monopolisieren (etwa durch restriktive ,Endbenutzer-Lizenzverträge,, ,Geheimhaltungsverträge,, ,Produktaktivierungen,, ,Dongles,, ,Kopiersperren,, proprietäre Formate oder den Vertrieb von ,binären, ,ausführbaren Programmen, ohne Quelltexte) und zwingen die Nutzer somit in die Abhängigkeit vom jeweiligen Entwickler-Unternehmen. Freie Software hingegen unterscheidet sich durch die gewährte Freiheit: Verwendung, Teilen, Modifizieren.
,Das Selbstverständnis der gewährten Freiheiten ist es, dass diese als notwendig für die Förderung des sozialen und ethischen Anliegens gesehen werden, welches die Freiheit und Gemeinschaft der Nutzer respektiert und wertschätzt (im Bereich von Computer-Nutzung und Datenverarbeitung), indem Freie Software aktiv Zusammenarbeit und Kooperation ermöglicht:,[30],[31],[32], Nutzer haben so die Möglichkeit, im Gebrauch ihrer Computer und Datenverarbeitung eine Gemeinschaft von ,Wohlwollen, und ethischer ,Aufrichtigkeit, gründen zu können. Freie Software kann für jeden Zweck verwendet werden (ohne Notwendigkeit einer Bindung an bestimmte soziale oder ethische Werte), aber die FSF und das GNU-Projekt fördern aktiv die Werte der Freiheit, Gemeinschaft, Zusammenarbeit und ethische Solidarität, welche Freie Software ermöglicht.,[33],[34],[35],
,Freie Software hat durch ihre Grundsätze einen starken Fokus auf Zusammenarbeit und Zusammenhelfen in einer Gemeinschaft: An öffentlich geführten Freie-Software-Projekten kann sich jeder beteiligen. Dies schließt den kommerziellen und gewerblichen Nutzen nicht aus, da diese Freiheit nicht eingeschränkt wird. Das Wort ,frei, im Begriff ,Freie Software, bezieht sich auf ,Freiheit, und nicht auf ,kostenlos,; Freie Software hat nichts mit monetären Kosten oder Geld zu tun.,[42], Freie Software ist in der Regel kostenlos, aber unterliegt keiner solchen Einschränkung. Eine freie Software darf kommerziell verwendet, zu jedem Preis verkauft oder weitervertrieben werden und ist dennoch Freie Software, solange die Freiheitsrechte sichergestellt bleiben. Dafür erlaubt die am häufigsten verwendete GPL jedoch nicht, eine GPL-Software kompiliert zu verkaufen und für die Quelltext-Bereitstellung einen gesonderten hohen Preis zu verlangen (über einer geringen Erstellungsgebühren, z. B. Medium), was Kommerzialisierungsoptionen von GPL-Software in der Praxis einschränken kann.,[43],[44],[45],
,Die Freiheiten im Umgang mit Freier Software sind durch Freie-Software-Lizenzen rechtlich verankert und können somit garantiert werden. Zu solchen Lizenzen gehören die ,GNU General Public License, (GPL), welche durch das ,Copyleft,-Prinzip besagt, dass Nutzern von bearbeiteten und wiederveröffentlichten Versionen der Software die gleichen Freiheiten gegeben werden müssen. Aber auch ,freizügige, Lizenzen wie die ,BSD-Lizenz, (die kein Copyleft erfordern) werden als Freie-Software-Lizenzen akzeptiert.
,Im Gegensatz zu proprietärer Software, bei der sich ein Code zum unbemerkten Ausspionieren/Überwachen, zur eingeschränkten Nutzung von Medien durch ,Digitale Beschränkungsverwaltung, sowie Hintertüren für unbemerktes ferngesteuertes Einschleusen von Änderungen (ungewollte, unbemerkte „Updates“) befinden kann, bietet Freie Software durch ihre Untersuchbarkeit eine Software, aus der jegliche unerwünschten und schädlichen Eigenschaften entfernt werden können und daher meist von vornherein nicht vorhanden sind.
,
,Philosophie-Betrachtungen von Freier Software,[,Bearbeiten, | ,Quelltext bearbeiten,],
,Bei Freier Software geht es darum, dass Nutzer Freiheiten für die empfangene Software erhalten: in erster Linie den Quelltext (um Änderungen machen zu können).
,
,Software kann einfach geändert oder vervielfältigt werden (im Gegensatz zu materiellen Objekten). Softwarenutzer sollen davon Gebrauch machen können, nicht nur die ursprünglichen Entwickler.,[2],
,Kochrezepte werden manchmal als Analogie für Freie Software verwendet:,[46], Ein Kochrezept ist dann freiheitsgewährend, wenn ein Empfänger es weitergeben darf (mit oder ohne Änderungen).,
,Dies bedeutet ,nicht,, dass Anhänger der ,Freie-Software-Bewegung, beim Restaurantbesuch das Rezept einer bestellten Speise verlangen oder auf der Offenlegung des Rezeptes bestehen. Der Grund ist, dass die Speise das Ergebnis (englisch Output) des Kochens ist, nicht eine Variante des Rezepts.,[47], (Beim Restaurantbesuch wird eine Speise bestellt, nicht die „Schritte, die zur Speise führen“). In selber Weise bestehen Anhänger der Freie-Software-Bewegung beim Empfang eines Dokuments nicht auf Offenlegung der Software, die zum Erstellen des Dokuments genutzt wurde. Allerdings würden Mitglieder der Freie-Software-Bewegung Daten-Formate ablehnen, die sie zwängen, ein proprietäres Programm zum Lesen/Verwenden (oder Abändern) eines Dokuments zu nutzen.,[48],
,Wenn ein Nutzer Software empfängt, so ist das ausführbare Programm eine ,direkte, Transformation des Quelltextes: Die Schritte im Programm sind eine ,direkte, Transformation (oder Variante) der Schritte/Beschreibungen im Quelltext. In freiheitsgewährenden Softwarelizenzen, wie der GNU GPL, wird dies als „Corresponding Source“ bezeichnet: korrespondierender Quelltext.,[49], Wenn Software als Freie Software weitergegeben wird, so muss ein Empfänger das Recht erhalten, den korrespondierenden Quelltext bekommen zu können (meist wird dieser sofort mit ausgeliefert), da somit das Recht gewährt wird, die Freiheit zu haben, die Software in adäquater Weise ändern zu können. Ohne den Quelltext (z. B. nur als binäres ausführbares Programm) ist es oft fast unmöglich, sinnvoll Änderungen an der Software vorzunehmen.,[50],[51], Dies begründet sich meist durch den für menschliche Leser sehr fremden Maschinen-Code, zu dem der Quelltext bei vielen Programmiersprachen kompiliert wird, um dann auf einem Computer lauffähig zu werden. Diese schwer zu ändernde Form der Software (Maschinen-Code) ist nicht ein Neu-Produkt oder ein etwaig durch Ressourcen-Knappheit schwierig zu erstellendes Artefakt, wenn von dem Quelltext ausgegangen wird. Stattdessen ist es eine komfortable ,direkte, Transformation des Quelltextes. Die Freie-Software-Bewegung plädiert für den Mitempfang des Quelltextes, da nur so der Aspekt der Analyse, Änderbarkeit und Kontrolle ausreichend möglich ist.,
,Mitglieder der Freie-Software-Gemeinschaft achten bei der Auswahl von Software-Paketen auf die Gewährung von Freiheiten, aus Gründen ihrer ,eigenen Freiheit,. Sie weigern sich zwar oft, proprietäre Software zu nutzen; sie weigern sich aber beispielsweise ,nicht,, „U-Bahnen zu nutzen, wenn diese Computer mit Windows haben, oder zu telefonieren, wenn der Anruf durch Verteiler geleitet wird, welche proprietäre Software nutzen, oder Internetverbindungen aufzubauen, wenn diese durch Router geleitet werden, welche proprietäre Software ausführen, oder T-Shirts zu bestellen, weil die Hersteller Windows nutzen könnte, um T-Shirts herzustellen.“,[52],[53], Es geht Mitgliedern der Freie-Software-Gemeinschaft primär um die Freiheit in der ,eigenen, Datenverarbeitung. Manche (so die ,FSF, oder ,FSFE,) engagieren sich in Öffentlichkeitsarbeit, um anderen Menschen die entsprechenden Aspekte der Freiheit in der Datenverarbeitung näher zu bringen.,
,Freie Software und Aspekte der Verfügbarkeit,[,Bearbeiten, | ,Quelltext bearbeiten,],
,Freiheitsgewährende Software (Freie Software) sagt nichts über die Verfügbarkeit der Software aus: Manche wird als öffentliches Projekt entwickelt (und ist somit jedem verfügbar), andere wird in kundenspezifischem Entwicklungs-Auftrag speziell für Unternehmen, Organisationen, Regierungen oder sogar einzelnen Nutzer entwickelt (und ist somit nur denen verfügbar, außer sie nutzen ihr Recht auf Weitergabe).,[54], Jedoch haben alle Empfänger mit dem Empfang der Software die Freiheitsrechte von Freier Software erhalten.
,Software, die von einer Vielzahl von Nutzern brauchbar ist (Programme für Textverarbeitung, Webbrowsing), wird bei freiheitsgewährender Software meist in öffentlichen Projekten entwickelt. Diese Programme sind Freie Software, die öffentlich verfügbar ist. Durch die Rechte Freier Software dürfen Nutzer Änderungen an dieser Software vornehmen oder diese Änderungen verbreiten, ohne die ursprünglichen Entwickler davon benachrichtigen zu müssen.,[55], Allerdings werden die Änderungen/Verbesserungen meist dem ursprünglichen Projekt zur Verfügung gestellt. Dadurch können die Verbesserungen ein fixer Teil der öffentliche Software werden (müssen also in dem Fall nicht immer selber dazugefügt werden, da etwaige Beiträge dann von der Community weitergewartet werden. Dies bedingt aber zuerst, dass sich die Koordinatoren des öffentlichen Projekts dafür entschieden haben, die spezifischen Verbesserungen bzw. Änderungen aufzunehmen und einzupflegen); außerdem kommen Verbesserungen der Allgemeinheit zugute, indem sich die Software durch unterschiedlich Beiträge verbessern kann. Da es bei öffentlichen Projekten Meinungsverschiedenheiten geben kann (oft auf rein technischer Ebene, wo unterschiedliche technische Ziele verfolgt werden können), kommt es dazu, dass ein öffentliches Projekt abgezweigt (ge-„forked“) wird und es fortan in zwei oder mehr unterschiedlichen separaten Varianten öffentlich,[Anm. 5], zur Verfügung steht. Dies basiert auf dem Recht, dass Freie Software änderbar ist (und die geänderte Version weiterverbreitbar ist).
,Freiheitsgewährende Software, die einem Empfänger erlauben, die Freiheiten bei darauffolgender Weitergabe wieder zu entziehen, wird ,freizügige Software, genannt. Freiheitsgewährende Software, die sicherstellt, dass empfangene Freiheiten bei Weitergabe der Software weitergegeben werden müssen, wird ,Copyleft,-Software genannt. Beides gilt als Freie Software (Copyleft sichert Freiheiten für jeden, indem die Freiheiten bei Weitergabe nicht wieder entzogen werden dürfen, wie es bei freizügiger Software der Fall ist.)
,Programmierer, die substanzielle Software der Öffentlichkeit als Freie Software zur Verfügung stellen, wählen (als Urheber) oft eine freiheitsgewährende Software-Lizenz mit Copyleft, da sie somit verhindern können, dass die Software von Unternehmen aufgegriffen wird und Teile daraus zu proprietärer Software verarbeitet werden, welche Nutzern wieder Freiheitsrechte entziehen würden. Andere wählen ein ,Dual-License,-Konzept aus, bei welchem die Software der Öffentlichkeit z. B. als Copyleft zur Verfügung steht, aber die Software gegen Bezahlung zu anderen Bedingungen erhältlich ist. Manche veröffentlichen Programme unter freizügigen Lizenzen (also ohne Copyleft); vor allem dann, wenn das Ziel verfolgt wird, ein Programm so breitflächig wie möglich (selbst für proprietäre Softwareentwickler) nutzbar zu machen (wenn es darum geht, ein neues Protokoll oder eine neue Bibliothek zu fördern).
,
,Freie Software und kommerzielle Aspekte,[,Bearbeiten, | ,Quelltext bearbeiten,],
,Freie Software darf ,kommerzielle, Software sein (kommerziell und ,proprietär, sind nicht das gleiche). Freie Software darf kommerziell verkauft und weitergegeben,[42], und kommerzielle Tätigkeiten (z. B. Support) dürfen angeboten werden. Natürlich darf dies auch ,gratis, geschehen, dann meist mit Verzicht auf ,Gewährleistung,. Freie Software ist aber nie proprietär, indem sie Nutzern die Freiheiten auf Modifizierung und Weitervertrieb verbietet oder unmöglich macht.,[56],
,Private oder kundenspezifische Software, welche für einen bestimmten Benutzer (normalerweise eine Organisation) entwickelt wurde (normalerweise gegen Bezahlung) und nicht öffentlich verfügbar ist, kann Freie Software sein. Dies ist der Fall, wenn der alleinige Benutzer der Software (der einzige Empfänger der Software) dennoch die vier Freiheiten erhalten hat.,[54],
,Die Freie-Software-Bewegung lehnt die These ab, dass Programmierer berechtigt seien, Nutzern Freiheiten zu entziehen, um Gewinn zu erzielen. Stattdessen wertet die Freie-Software-Bewegung das Recht auf Freiheit der Nutzer höher als einen finanziellen Gewinn von Programmierern oder Software-Unternehmen, wenn dieser auf Kosten der Freiheit anderer (Eigenkontrolle und/oder Gemeinschaft, oder Privatsphäre) basiert.,[57], Deswegen erlaubt die am häufigsten verwendete GPL zwar die Kommerzialisierung, erlaubt es jedoch nicht, für den Quelltext mehr zu verlangen als für das kompilierte Programm (ausgenommen zusätzlicher Bereitstellungsgebühren z. B. für das Medium), was die Kommerzialisierung von GPL Software erschweren kann.,[43],[44],
,Die Freie-Software-Bewegung ist aber durchaus für eine Bezahlung von Programmierern, wenn diese die Freiheit der Nutzer achten,,[58], sowie für alle Geschäftsmöglichkeiten rund um Freie Software (Support, Wartung, Betreuung). Richard Stallman schildert mögliche Szenarien einer Softwaresteuer, mit der eine Regierung Geld für die Entwicklung von allgemeinnütziger Software (die zusätzlich Freiheiten gewährt) zur Verfügung stellen könnte.,[59],
,
,Freie Software aus gesellschaftlicher Sicht,[,Bearbeiten, | ,Quelltext bearbeiten,],
,Beitrag zur Diskussion über die Wirtschaftsordnung,[,Bearbeiten, | ,Quelltext bearbeiten,],
,Einige Menschen sehen in der Freie-Software-Bewegung Ansätze, die Möglichkeiten zur Überwindung des ,Kapitalismus, zu zeigen. In Deutschland beschäftigt sich unter anderem das Projekt ,Oekonux, mit dieser Thematik. Andere sehen in freier Software lediglich einen weiteren Wettbewerber innerhalb der ,marktwirtschaftlichen, Ordnung. Die Freiheit, die Software in andere Sprachen zu übersetzen, kommt besonders denjenigen ,Sprachgruppen, zugute, für die eine Übersetzung bisher kommerziell nicht interessant war.
,
,Beitrag zur Reduktion der digitalen Kluft,[,Bearbeiten, | ,Quelltext bearbeiten,],
,Die Freiheit der Software wird vom ,UNO-Weltgipfel zur Informationsgesellschaft, (WSIS) als schützenswert anerkannt. Sie gehört zu den elementaren Forderungen der Zivilgesellschaft, mit der die „,Digitale Kluft,“ überwunden werden soll. Unter „digitaler Kluft“ wird die Spaltung in Regionen der Erde bezeichnet, die sich die Schaffung von ,IT-Infrastruktur, und damit vor allem die Teilnahme am ,Internet, leisten können, und solchen, die dies nicht können. Anders als bei proprietärer Software fließt bei der Verwendung freier Software kein Geld in fremde Länder ab, wo die Anbieter proprietärer Software ihren Unternehmenshauptsitz haben. Alle Mittel, die vor Ort für die IT bereitstehen, können daher unmittelbar in die IT-Wirtschaft vor Ort einfließen.

,Geschichte,[,Bearbeiten, | ,Quelltext bearbeiten,],
,Entwicklungen im Vorfeld,[,Bearbeiten, | ,Quelltext bearbeiten,],
,1931 gründete ,Thomas J. Watson Sr., von ,IBM, ein ,Methods Research Department, um das Wissen zum Betrieb seiner Datenverarbeitungsverfahren zu sammeln und effektiv mit seinen Kunden zu teilen,,[61], was IBM mit den Nutzergruppen ,SHARE (Society to Help Avoid Redundant Effort), und GUIDE für seine Mainframe-Programmierung fortführte.,[62], Bis 1970 wurde Software von IBM kostenlos und inklusive Quellcode zur Verfügung gestellt.,[63], Zwischen 1960 und 1970 etablierte sich unter anderem an akademischen US-Einrichtungen (,Stanford,, ,Berkeley,, ,Carnegie Mellon, und ,MIT,) eine „,Hacker,-Kultur“, für die es selbstverständlich war, eigene Software-Verbesserungen mit anderen Programmierern zu teilen. Programmierer tauschten die Software frei untereinander aus und gaben häufig den entsprechenden Quelltext weiter. Insbesondere in großen Benutzergruppen wie der ,DEC, User Group (DECUS) war dies üblich. Es war gängige Praxis, den Quelltext der mit ,Computersystemen, ausgelieferten Software mitzuliefern. Dadurch kamen viele Vorschläge für Verbesserungen und Fehlerkorrekturen zu den Computerherstellern zurück. Software wurde als Zugabe zu Computern gesehen, um diese nutzbar zu machen.
,Am 23. Juni 1969,[64], kündigte IBM neue Regeln für die Nutzung und Wartung seiner Software, getrennt von den Hardware-Nutzungsbedingungen an. Für Software wurde urheberrechtlicher Schutz in Verbindung mit Lizenzverträgen eingeführt.,[65], Die bislange freie Dienstleistung zur Wartung und Weiterentwicklung von Software wurde gesondert berechnet, was einen eigenen Wirtschaftsmarkt für diesen Dienstleistungssektor begründete. In den späten 1970er-Jahren begannen gleichfalls andere Unternehmen, „Softwarelizenzen“ einzuführen, welche den Nutzen, die Weitergabe und die Möglichkeit der Veränderung der Programme einschränkte. Außerdem wurden viele Programme nicht mehr im Quelltext geliefert, sondern nur noch in maschinenlesbarer Form, zum Schutz der Software als Geschäftsgeheimnis, was eine Veränderung nahezu unmöglich machte. Zusätzlich wurde es mit dem Aufkommen von finanzierbaren Mikrocomputern von ,IBM,, ,Apple,, ,Atari, oder ,Commodore, üblich, Software getrennt von Computer-,Hardware, zu verkaufen und den Quelltext vor der Konkurrenz zu verbergen, die Software wurde somit proprietär. Immer mehr ,Hacker, wurden von den Softwareunternehmen angestellt, und die bisher wahrgenommenen Freiheiten wurden stark eingeschränkt, Software wurde zu einem künstlich verknappten Gut.
,In diese Zeit fiel die Arbeit von Richard Stallman am „AI Lab“ (Abteilung für ,Künstliche Intelligenz,) des ,Massachusetts Institute of Technology,. Als dort ebenfalls proprietäre Software in den Laboren eingeführt wurde, bemühte Stallman sich darum, durch das Programmieren alternativer Software eine Monopolstellung proprietärer Anbieter zu verhindern. Er folgte damit seinen Prinzipien einer wissenschaftlichen Zusammenarbeit, die einen freien und ungehinderten Austausch von Software vorsahen.

,
,„Mit dem Verlust meiner Ge­mein­schaft war es unmöglich, weiter­zu­machen wie zuvor. Statt­dessen stand ich vor einer gänzlich mo­ra­li­schen Ent­schei­dung.
, Die einfache Wahl wäre es gewesen, der pro­prietä­ren Software-Welt bei­zu­treten, Ver­traulich­keits­verein­barungen zu unter­zeichnen und zu ver­sprechen, meinen Mit-Hackern nicht zu helfen. Sehr wahr­schein­lich würde ich Software entwickeln, die unter Ver­traulich­keits­verein­barungen ausgegeben würde, und so den Druck auf andere Leute erhöhen, ihre Kameraden auch zu verraten.
, Ich hätte auf diese Art Geld verdienen und mich vielleicht mit dem Schreiben von Code vergnügen können. Aber ich wusste, dass ich am Ende meiner Karriere auf Jahre zurück­blicken würde, in denen ich Wände gebaut habe; Wände, welche die Menschen von­einander trennen. Ich würde dann das Gefühl haben, dass ich mein Leben damit verbracht hatte, die Welt zu einem schlech­teren Ort zu machen. […]
, Eine andere Wahl­möglich­keit, die direkt, aber un­er­freu­lich gewesen wäre, war, mich überhaupt nicht mehr mit Computern zu befassen. Auf diese Art wären meine Fähig­keiten nicht miss­braucht worden, aber sie wären anderer­seits auch ver­schwendet worden. Ich wäre dann zwar nicht schuld daran, dass Computer-Nutzer von­einander getrennt und ein­ge­schränkt werden, aber ich hätte es auch nicht ver­hindert.
, Also suchte ich nach einem Weg, auf dem ein Pro­gram­mierer etwas Gutes tun kann. Ich fragte mich selbst: Gibt es ein Programm oder Programme, die ich schreiben könnte, um wieder eine Gemein­schaft möglich zu machen?“

,Die Entstehung Freier Software,[,Bearbeiten, | ,Quelltext bearbeiten,],
,Das Unternehmen AT&T entschied sich 1983, eine proprietäre Version seines ,Unix, auf den Markt zu bringen: UNIX ,System V,. Im September 1983 gründete ,Richard Stallman, das GNU-Projekt mit dem Ziel, ein freies, UNIX-ähnliches Betriebssystem mit Namen „GNU“ zu entwickeln.,[67],
,Damit die Idee der Freiheit auch rechtlich abgesichert sein würde, mussten freie ,Lizenzen, erdacht werden. Stallman entwarf das Copyleft-Prinzip, das bedeutet, ,dass alle, die die Software (mit oder ohne Änderungen) weiter verteilen, die Freiheit zum Weitergeben und Verändern mitgeben müssen. Das Copyleft garantiert, dass alle Benutzer Freiheit haben., Auf diesem Prinzip beruhen die Lizenzen der GNU-Software.
,Eine organisatorische Basis für GNU und Freie Software überhaupt ist die 1985 gegründete, gemeinnützige Stiftung ,Free Software Foundation, (FSF). Für Softwareprojekte bestanden in den frühen und mittleren achtziger Jahren noch jeweils individuelle Lizenzen. Stallman verband die Rahmenpunkte zu einer einzelnen Lizenz und veröffentlichte 1989 die ,GNU General Public License, (GNU GPL). Diese ist die heute am stärksten verbreitete Lizenz für Freie Software.
,1991 war das ,GNU,-Betriebssystem bis auf den ,Kernel, vollständig. Einige Leute erkannten, dass ,Linux,, ein damals proprietärer Kernel für ,Minix,, sich für GNU eignen könnte. Nachdem die Entwickler den Linux-Kernel unter die „GNU GPL“ stellten, konnte zum ersten Mal ein vollständig freies Betriebssystem ausgebaut werden. Mit der darauffolgenden rasanten Entwicklung und Verbreitung von GNU und Linux wurde freie Software von zunehmend mehr Menschen genutzt.
,
,Verteidigung Freier Software,[,Bearbeiten, | ,Quelltext bearbeiten,],
,Es gab zwei größere Prozesse, bei denen Unternehmen versuchten, freie Software in ihren ausschließlichen Besitz zu bringen:
,1992 klagte ,AT&T, gegen die ,Universität von Kalifornien, um die Rechte an den ,UNIX,-Quellen. Wie sich herausstellte, hatte ,AT&T, die freie universitäre Produktion insgesamt in ihren Bestand übernommen und lediglich die Urheberangaben entfernt. Im Rahmen eines Vergleichs erhielt ,AT&T, von etwa 18.000 umstrittenen Dateien ausschließliche Rechte an dreien.
,2003 klagte ,SCO, gegen ,IBM, um die Rechte an den Linux-Quellen. ,SCO, begründete den Vorstoß mit angeblichen Verletzungen des Urheberrechts an ,UNIX,. ,IBM, hätte Quelltexte aus ,UNIX, illegal nach ,Linux, übertragen. ,SCO, konnte die Behauptung im Prozess aber nicht belegen. Das Verfahren endete, als sich herausstellte, dass ,SCO, nicht im Besitz von ,UNIX,-Urheberrechten war, sondern diese bei ,Novell, lagen.

,
,Geschäftsmodelle,[,Bearbeiten, | ,Quelltext bearbeiten,],
,Freie Software kann, gemäß den vier Freiheiten, meist nahezu beliebig kopiert und weitergegeben werden. Freie Software darf zwar zu einem beliebig hohen Preis verkauft werden, doch ist sie fast immer kostenlos im Internet erhältlich, und so ist ihr Verkaufswert auf ,Datenträgern, meist nicht viel höher als die ,Selbstkosten,. Eine bemerkenswerte Ausnahme ist das ,GNU-Projekt,, das Freie Software mit deutlicher Profitspanne anbietet und in den 1980er-Jahren einen erheblichen Teil seiner Einnahmen aus dem Verkauf von Software bestritt. Das GNU-Projekt hatte damals jedoch wegen seiner zentralen Rolle bei der Entwicklung freier Software und der damals geringen Verbreitung und Leistungsfähigkeit des Internets eine besondere Rolle, die es heute nicht mehr gibt.
,Einige ,Geschäftsmodelle,, die mit freier Software zu tun haben, konzentrieren sich deswegen auf den ,Dienstleistungsaspekt, der Softwareentwicklung, -weiterentwicklung und -anpassung. Wartung und individuelle Anpassung der Software sowie Schulung und technische Unterstützung sind für die Kunden vorrangig. Unternehmen, die allein diese Dienstleistungen als Geschäftsstrategie gewählt haben, sind zum Beispiel ,MySQL AB,, ,Red Hat, und ,Qt Development Frameworks,. Freie Software unterliegt keiner ,Rivalität, und nicht der ,Ausschließbarkeit,, ist somit ein ,reines öffentliches Gut, und kann folglich nicht einem üblichen Marktgeschehen unterliegen. Dennoch betrachten die Herausgeber proprietärer Software sie als eine ernste Bedrohung für ihr Geschäftsmodell der ,Lizenzierung, und versuchen deshalb, potenzielle Kunden von der Benutzung freier Software abzuhalten. Trotzdem sind Hersteller proprietärer Software aktive Nutzer von freier Software und unterstützen die Verfügbarkeit von proprietärer Software auf Plattformen, die auf freier Software basieren.
,Als Argumente für ihre Produkte führen Hersteller proprietärer Software unter anderem mehr Garantien, bessere Qualität – besonders im Hinblick auf Benutzerfreundlichkeit und bessere Dienstleistungen – an. Solche Argumente, die auf Versprechungen von Open Source, nicht von freier Software kontern, hat Richard M. Stallman wiederholt als tendenziös und thematisch verfehlt angegriffen; in seinen Augen ist die Entscheidung für oder gegen Freie Software primär eine ethische und soziale Entscheidung, von der nicht durch Qualitätsdiskussionen abgelenkt werden darf.
,
,Lizenzen,[,Bearbeiten, | ,Quelltext bearbeiten,],
,Es gibt verschiedene Typen von ,Softwarelizenzen,, die die Kriterien freier Software erfüllen:
,
,Copyleft-Lizenzen, die GNU General Public License (,GNU GPL,) ist die am häufigsten verwendete. Der Autor behält das ,Copyright,, und es sind Klauseln enthalten, dass veränderte und weitergegebene Software frei bleibt. Auch der Quellcode muss zur Verfügung gestellt werden.,
,Bei ,BSD-artigen Lizenzen, behält der Autor das Copyright. Diese dem Grundsatz „Ehre, wem Ehre gebührt“ folgende Lizenz enthält den Namen des Autors und oft auch eine ,Haftungsbeschränkung,. Veränderung und Weitergabe in jeder Form ist erlaubt, das heißt, sie darf auch in proprietäre Software eingebaut werden. In diese Klasse fallen die ,Apache-Lizenz, und die ,MIT-Lizenz,.,
,Gemeinfreiheit,. Der Autor verzichtet auf das Copyright. Damit kann jeder alles mit der Software machen, sie etwa in eigene Programme einbauen, verkaufen oder sie selbst wieder zu ,proprietärer Software, machen. Gemeinfreiheit ist jedoch keine Lizenz, sondern ein gemeinfreies Werk ist besitzlos. In Staaten, in denen keine Gemeinfreiheit von Software möglich ist (etwa in Teilen der ,Europäischen Union,), weil etwa die Urheberrechtsgesetze eine bewusste Übergabe in die Gemeinfreiheit nicht zulassen und die Schutzfristen nach dem Tod eines Autors so lang sind, dass noch keine Gemeinfreiheit jemals geschriebener Software eingetreten ist, wird statt der Gemeinfreiheit eine Lizenzierung verwendet, die dem Lizenznehmer keinerlei Verpflichtungen auferlegt und ihn von allen durch die allgemeinen Copyright-Regelungen auferlegten Beschränkungen befreit (zum Beispiel die ,Do What The Fuck You Want To Public License, (WTFPL) oder die ,CC0,).,

,Gefahren für Freie Software,[,Bearbeiten, | ,Quelltext bearbeiten,],
,Proprietäre Schnittstellen,[,Bearbeiten, | ,Quelltext bearbeiten,],
,Hardware-Hersteller gehen immer mehr dazu über, die Schnittstellenspezifikationen geheim zu halten, um der Konkurrenz die Nachahmung technischer Lösungsansätze zu verwehren. Der Grund hierfür liegt im zunehmenden Wettbewerbsdruck und darin, dass es billiger ist und schneller geht, einen solchen Schutz technisch einzubauen, als das errungene geistige Gut durch ein Patent für sich zu reservieren. Wenn nicht öffentlich dokumentiert ist, wie die Geräte anzusteuern sind, erleidet die Hardwareunterstützung freier Betriebssysteme mittels freier Treiber einen schweren Rückschlag, da sie allenfalls noch durch ,Reverse Engineering, in Gang gebracht werden kann.
,Andererseits haben die Hersteller die Benutzer der wichtigeren freien Betriebssysteme (vor allem ,GNU/Linux, – wobei insbesondere ,Linux, und der ,X.Org-Server, relevant sind) als Kundengruppe erkannt. Viele von ihnen stellen jedoch ,proprietäre Treiber, zur Verfügung. Diese Treiber stoßen unter den Anhängern freier Software auf höchst geteilte Meinungen: einige sind glücklich darüber, dass sie die „Unterstützung“ der Hardware-Hersteller gewonnen haben und deren Hardware durch das von ihnen bevorzugte Betriebssystem nun mehr oder weniger unterstützt wird, andere lehnen proprietäre Treiber grundsätzlich ab.
,Von einer generellen Schnittstellenfreigabe würden die Benutzer freier Betriebssysteme sicherlich profitieren. Neben den ideologischen kommen hier Fragen der Systemstabilität zum Tragen. Sollte beispielsweise ein proprietärer Linux-Netzwerkkartentreiber regelmäßig zu Abstürzen des Systems führen, wären die Linux-Entwickler dagegen machtlos und es hinge vom Gutdünken des Herstellers ab, ob der Fehler behoben wird.
,
,Softwarepatente,[,Bearbeiten, | ,Quelltext bearbeiten,],
,Die regelmäßig in den Schlagzeilen auftauchenden ,Softwarepatente, haben auf Freie Software einen besonders schwerwiegenden Einfluss, denn es ist zum Teil rechtlich noch nicht einmal möglich, mit freier Software die Patentauflagen zu erfüllen. Diese bestehen nämlich in einigen Fällen auf einer Gebühr pro in Umlauf gebrachter Kopie, aber Freie Software verlangt gerade, dass der Herausgeber darauf keinen Einfluss haben darf. Selbst wenn er die Lizenzgebühren zum Beispiel durch Spenden zahlen würde, müsste er eine genaue Zahl der Kopien, die im Umlauf sind, vorlegen können, womit es keine Freie Software mehr wäre.
,
,Trusted Computing,[,Bearbeiten, | ,Quelltext bearbeiten,],
,Trusted Computing, kann Veränderungen an einer Computer-Plattform eindeutig erkennen und damit sowohl externe Software-Angriffe als auch Veränderungen durch den Benutzer, Konfigurationen, Fehlfunktionen, Sicherheitslücken oder von Anwendungsprogrammen eindeutig identifizieren. Die Reaktion auf eine solche Veränderung kann (aber muss nicht) durch ein entsprechendes, sicheres Betriebssystem erfolgen. Trusted Computing kann daher auch zur Absicherung von ,Digital Rights Management, (DRM) und zum ,Kopierschutz, verwendet werden.
,Politisch gesehen, muss Freie Software immer vom Benutzer ersetzbar und veränderbar sein. Software, die in binärer Form zertifiziert sein muss, ist dies nicht. ,Technisch gesehen, kann in freier Software vor dem Benutzer nichts im Binärcode verheimlicht werden, weil der Quellcode für jeden zugänglich sein muss. Somit kann die Verschlüsselung, mit der die Daten vor dem Benutzer „bewahrt“ werden, einfacher hintergangen werden.
,Eine weitere Inkompatibilität tut sich mit dem Kopierschutz von DVDs auf: Die Umgehung wirksamer Kopierschutzmaßnahmen ist seit den um die Jahrtausendwende weltweit nach und nach etablierten Reformen zum Copyright (in den ,USA, der ,Digital Millennium Copyright Act, (DMCA)) gesetzlich nur noch mit Zustimmung des Rechteinhabers erlaubt. Dieses Verbot erstreckt sich auf die Herstellung oder Verbreitung von Programmen, die diese Maßnahmen umgehen können, so dass freie ,Abspielsoftware, für ,kopiergeschützte, DVDs nicht legal geschrieben werden kann – aus ihren natürlichen Interessen heraus würden die Rechteinhaber ihre Zustimmung dazu niemals erteilen, weil dadurch der Sinn der Maßnahmen ,ad absurdum, geführt würde.
,Falls Hardwarehersteller wie ,Intel, oder ,AMD, funktionseinschränkende Verfahren in Chipsätze oder Prozessoren implementieren sollten, könnte Freie Software den vollen Funktionsumfang möglicherweise nur noch auf ,freier Hardware, entfalten.

,ISO/IEC 19752, ,Information technology — Method for the determination of toner cartridge yield for monochromatic electrophotographic printers and multi-function devices that contain printer components, is an ,ISO,/,IEC, standard method for the determination of ,toner, cartridge yield for monochrome ,laser printers,, introduced in June 2004 and updated in 2017.
,Traditionally, printer manufacturers did not employ a standard, well-defined methodology for measuring toner cartridge yield. The most widely used description of cartridge capacity was ""number of printed pages at approximately 5% coverage"", with final results depending on a number of factors.
,In contrast, ISO/IEC 19752 strives for a comprehensive and rigorous definition of the measurement process with the purpose of creating clear and objective criteria for comparison of cartridge yields. In particular, the standard provides a detailed definition and description of:
,
,Test preparations and environmental conditions,
,Sample size (at least 3 printers with 3 cartridges each),
,Paper type,
,Print mode,
,Test document (provided in ,PDF, format),
,Cartridge and printer source (,not, supplied by manufacturer; purchased on the open market from at least three different sources),
,Error and process handling,
,End-of-life criteria (for example, how many times the cartridges should be shaken),

,Collaborative software,
,Word processor,
,Website,google,.com,/docs,
,Google Docs, is an online ,word processor, included as part of the free, web-based ,Google Docs Editors, suite offered by ,Google,, which also includes ,Google Sheets,, ,Google Slides,, ,Google Drawings,, ,Google Forms,, ,Google Sites, and ,Google Keep,. Google Docs is accessible via an ,internet browser, as a ,web-based application, and is also available as a ,mobile app, on ,Android, and ,iOS, and as a ,desktop application, on Google's ,ChromeOS,.
,Google Docs allows users to create and edit documents online while collaborating with other users in real time. Edits are tracked by the user making the edit, with a revision history presenting changes.,[1], An editor's position is highlighted with an editor-specific color and cursor, and a permissions system regulates what users can do. Updates have introduced features using ,machine learning,, including ""Explore"", offering search results based on the contents of a document, and ""Action items"", allowing users to assign tasks to other users.,[2],
,Google Docs supports opening and saving documents in the standard ,OpenDocument, format as well as in ,Rich text format,, plain ,Unicode, text, ,zipped, ,HTML,, and ,Microsoft Word,. Exporting to ,PDF, and ,EPUB, formats is implemented.
,
,
,History,[,edit,],
,Google Docs originated from Writely, a ,web-based, ,word processor, created by the software company Upstartle and launched in August 2005.,[3],[4], It began as an experiment by programmers Sam Schillace, Steve Newman and Claudia Carpenter, trying out the then-new ,Ajax, technology and the ""contentEditable"" HTML feature.,[4], On March 9, 2006, Google announced that it had acquired Upstartle.,[5],[6], In July 2009, Google dropped the ,beta testing status, from Google Docs.,[7], In March 2010, Google acquired DocVerse, an online document collaboration company. DocVerse allowed multiple user online collaboration on ,Microsoft Word, documents, as well as other ,Microsoft Office, formats, such as ,Excel, and ,PowerPoint,.,[8], Improvements based on DocVerse were announced and deployed in April 2010.,[9], In June 2012, Google acquired ,Quickoffice,, a freeware proprietary productivity suite for mobile devices.,[10], In October 2012, Google renamed the ,Google Drive, products and Google Documents became Google Docs. At the same time, ,Google Chrome App, versions of Google Docs, ,Google Sheets,, and ,Google Slides, were released, which provided shortcuts to the service on Chrome's new tab page.,[11], In February 2019, Google announced grammar suggestions in Docs, expanding their spell check by using machine translation techniques to help catch tricky grammatical errors.,[12], In March of 2023, Google Docs, along with Slides and Sheets, introduced a new UI theme.,[13],
,
,Platforms,[,edit,],
,Google Docs is available as a ,web application, supported on: ,Google Chrome,, ,Firefox,, ,Microsoft Edge, and ,Safari, web browsers.,[14], Users can access all Docs, as well as other files, collectively through the ,Google Drive, website. In June 2014, Google rolled out a dedicated website homepage for Docs, that contains only files created with the service.,[15], In 2014, Google launched a dedicated mobile app for Docs on the ,Android, and ,iOS, mobile operating systems.,[16],[17],[18], The mobile website for Docs was updated in 2015 with a ""simpler, more uniform"" interface, and while users can read files through the mobile websites, users trying to edit will be redirected towards the dedicated mobile app, thus preventing editing on the mobile web.,[19],
,
,Features,[,edit,],
,Editing,[,edit,],
,Collaboration and revision history,[,edit,],
,Collaborative editing, on Google Docs can be useful for documents and essays,
,Google, Docs and the other apps in the ,Google Drive, suite serve as a tool for ,collaborative editing, of documents in real time. Documents can be shared, opened, and edited by multiple users simultaneously and users can see character-by-character changes as other collaborators make edits. Changes are automatically saved to ,Google,'s servers, and a revision history is automatically kept so past edits may be viewed and reverted.,[20], To resolve concurrent edits from different users, Google Docs uses an ,operational transformation, method based on the Jupiter algorithm, where the document is stored as a ,list of changes,.,[21],[22],
,An editor's current position is represented with an editor-specific color/cursor, so if another editor happens to be viewing that part of the document, they can see edits as they occur. A sidebar chat functionality allows collaborators to discuss edits. The revision history allows users to see the additions made to a document, with each author distinguished by color. Only adjacent revisions can be compared, and users cannot control how frequently revisions are saved. Files can be exported to a user's local computer in a variety of formats (,ODF,, ,HTML,, ,PDF,, ,RTF,, ,Text,, ,Office Open XML,).
,
,Explore,[,edit,],
,In March 2014, Google introduced add-ons, new tools from third-party developers that add more features to Google Docs.,[23], To view and edit documents offline on a computer, users need to be using the Google Chrome web browser. A ,Chrome extension,, Google Docs Offline, allows users to enable offline support for Docs files on the Google Drive website.,[24], The Android and iOS apps natively support offline editing.,[25],[26],
,In June 2014, Google introduced ""Suggested edits"" in Google Docs; as part of the ""commenting access"" permission, participants can come up with suggestions for edits that the author can accept or reject, in contrast to full editing ability.,[17], In October 2016, Google announced ""Action items"" for Docs. If a user writes phrases such as ""Ryan to follow up on the keynote script"", the service will intelligently assign that action to ""Ryan"". Google states this will make it easier for other collaborators to see which person is responsible for what task. When a user visits Google Drive, Docs, Sheets, or Slides, any files with tasks assigned to them will be highlighted with a badge.,[27],
,A basic research tool was introduced in 2012.,[28],[29],[30], This was expanded into ""Explore"" in September 2016, which has additional functionality through ,machine learning,.,[31],[32],[33], In Google Docs, Explore shows relevant Google search results based on information in the document, simplifying information gathering. Users can also mark specific document text, press Explore, and see search results based on the marked text only.
,In December 2016, Google introduced a quick citations feature to Google Docs. The quick citation tool allows users to ""insert citations as footnotes with the click of a button"" on the web through the Explore feature introduced in September. The citation feature also marked the launch of the Explore functionalities in G Suite for Education accounts.,[34],[35],[36],
,
,Files,[,edit,],
,Supported file formats,[,edit,],
,For formatted text documents: ,OpenDocument,, ,Rich text format,, ,zipped, ,HTML,, ,Unicode, ,plain text,, ,Microsoft Word,.,[37],
,File limits,[,edit,],
,Limits to insertable file sizes, overall document length and size are listed below:,[38],[39],
,
,Up to 1.02 million characters, regardless of the number of pages or font size. Document files converted to .gdoc (Docs) format cannot be larger than 50 MB. Images inserted cannot be larger than 50 MB, and must be in either .jpg, .png, or .gif formats.,
,Google Workspace,[,edit,],
,Google Docs and the ,Google Docs Editors, suite are free of charge for use by individuals but are also available as part of Google's business-centered ,Google Workspace,, enabling additional business-focused functionality on payment of a monthly subscription.,[40],
,
,Other functionality,[,edit,],
,A simple find and replace tool is available. Google offers an extension for the Google Chrome web browser called ,Office editing for Docs, Sheets and Slides, that enables users to view and edit Microsoft Word documents on Google Chrome via the Docs app. The extension can be used for opening Office files stored on the computer using Chrome, as well as for opening Office files encountered on the web (in the form of email attachments, web search results, etc.) without having to download them. The extension is installed on ChromeOS by default.,[41], ,Google Cloud Connect, was a plug-in for ,Microsoft Office, 2003, 2007, and 2010 that could automatically store and synchronize any ,Word, document to Google Docs (before the introduction of Drive) in Google Docs or Microsoft Office formats. The online copy was automatically updated each time the Microsoft Word document was saved. Microsoft Word documents could be edited offline and synchronized later when online. Google Cloud Connect maintained previous Microsoft Word document versions and allowed multiple users to collaborate by working on the same document at the same time.,[42],[43], Google Cloud Connect was discontinued in April 2013 as, according to Google, Google Drive achieves all of the above tasks, ""with better results"".,[44], In January 2022, Google announced the ,text watermark, feature to the word processor, allowing users to create or import watermarks to a document. In addition to text watermarks, image watermarks can also be added to the document.,[45],[46],
,
,Reception,[,edit,],
,In a December 2016 review of Google Docs and the Drive software suite, Edward Mendelsohn of ,PC Magazine, wrote that the suite was ""visually elegant"" with ""effortless collaboration"", but that Docs, as paired with ,Sheets, and ,Slides,, was ""less powerful than desktop-based suites"". Comparing Google's office suite with ,Microsoft Office, and Apple's ,iWork,, he stated that ""Docs exists ,only, in your Web browser"", meaning that users have a ""more limited feature set"" than ""the spacious, high-powered setting of a desktop app"". He wrote that offline support required a plug-in, describing it as ""less convenient than a desktop app, and you have to remember to install it before you need it"". Mendelsohn praised the ,user interface,, describing it as ""elegant, highly usable"" with ""fast performance"", and that the revision history ""alerts you to recent changes, and stores fine-grained records of revisions"". Regarding the Explore functionality, he credited it for being the ""niftiest new feature"" in the suite and that it surpassed comparable features in Microsoft Office. He described the quality of imports of Word files as ""impressive fidelity"". He summarized by praising Docs and the Drive suite for having ""the best balance of speed and power, and the best collaboration features, too"", while noting that ""it lacks a few features offered by Microsoft Office 365, but it was also faster to load and save in our testing"".,[47],
,
,Issues,[,edit,],
,2017 phishing incident,[,edit,],
,In May 2017, a phishing attack impersonated a Google Docs sharing email spread on the Internet. The attack sent emails pretending to be someone the target knew, requesting to share a document with them. Once the link in the email was pressed, users were directed to a real Google account permissions page where the phishing software, a third-party app named ""Google Docs"", requested access to the user's Google account. Once granted, the software received access to the user's ,Gmail, messages and address book and sent new fraudulent document invitations to their contacts.,[48], The phishing attack was described by media outlets as ""massive"",[49], and ""widespread"",,[50], and ,The Next Web,',s Napier Lopez wrote that it's ""very easy to fall for"".,[49], One of the reasons the attack was so effective was that its email messages passed through spam and security software, and used a real Google address.,[51], Within hours, the attack was stopped and fixed by Google, with a spokesperson stating that ""We have taken action to protect users against an email impersonating Google Docs and have disabled offending accounts. We've removed the fake pages, pushed updates through Safe Browsing, and our abuse team is working to prevent this kind of spoofing from happening again"".,[52],[53],
,On the same day, Google updated Gmail on Android to feature protection from ,phishing, attacks.,[54],[55],[56], Media outlets noticed that, while the added protection was announced on the same day as the attack, it ""may not have prevented this week's attack, however, as that attack involved a malicious and fake ""Google Docs"" app that was hosted on Google's own domain"".,[56], In early May 2017, ,Ars Technica, reported that ""at least three security researchers"" had raised issues about the threat, one of them in October 2011, and that the attacker or attackers behind the actual incident ""may have copied the technique from a proof of concept posted by one security researcher to ,GitHub, in February"". Furthermore, the report noted that Google had been repeatedly warned by researchers about the potential threat, with security researcher Greg Carson telling ,Ars Technica, that ""I don't think Google fully understood how severely this could be abused, but certainly, hackers did"".,[57],
,
,2017 ""Terms of Service"" error,[,edit,],
,In October 2017, Google released a server-side update to its codebase, which started incorrectly flagging random documents as unspecified violations of its ""Terms of Service"" policies. A fix was released shortly afterwards,,[58],[59], though the issue became noteworthy for the extent of Google's control over users' content, including its analysis of the contents of documents, as well as for its ability to shut users out at any time, including during critical moments of work.,[60],[61],

,ISO 19600,, ,Compliance management systems - Guidelines,, is a compliance standard introduced by the ,International Organization for Standardization, (ISO) in April 2014. As its title suggests, it operates as an advisory standard and is not used for accreditation or certification.
,This standard was developed by ISO Project Committee ISO/PC 271, which was chaired by Martin Tolar. In recent times technical committee ISO/TC 309 has been created and the maintenance and future development of ISO 19600 will be undertaken by members of this committee.
,Currently, ISO/TC 309 is in the process of developing ISO/DIS 37301 ,[1],, which is expected to replace ISO 19600. The main difference between these two standards is that, when published, ISO 37301 will establish requirements for the implementation of a compliance management system, as opposed to USO 19600 which only provides recommendations. This means that in the future, organizations can have their compliance management system (CMS) verified through an independent third party ,[2],
,
,
,Origins,[,edit,],
,Standards Australia, proposed a new ISO standard, based on the existing Australian standard "",AS 3806, - Compliance Programs,"", which was issued in 1998 and updated in 2006. The handbook to accompany AS 3806 was developed by a working group of the Australasian Compliance Institute members. This standard is more widely used in the financial industry, being endorsed by ,Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, and the ,Australian Securities & Investments Commission,. The published version of ISO 19600:2014 is similar to AS 3806:2006 standard, and will replace it.
,The draft stage of ISO 19600 was completed in April 2014;,[1], the final version was published on 5 December 2014.
,
,Main requirements of the standard,[,edit,],
,The ISO 19600:2014 adopts the ""ISO High Level Structure (HSL)"" in 10 main clauses in the following breakdown ,[3],:
,
,1 Scope,
,2 Normative references,
,3 Terms and definitions,
,4 Context of the organization,
,5 Leadership,
,6 Planning,
,7 Support,
,8 Operation,
,9 Performance Evaluation,
,10 Improvement,
,Structure of the standard,[,edit,],
,ISO 19600 helps organizations establish, develop, evaluate, and maintain a compliance management system. It brings together separate standards of ,compliance management, and ,risk management,, and its processes align very closely with ,ISO 31000,, another risk management standard.,[2],
,Many existing compliance standards focus on one specific regulatory requirement or topic area; ISO 19600 aims to unify these, so organizations can work within a single framework rather than several different ones focussing on different standards. Unlike ,PS 980,, ISO does not mandate any specific auditing requirements.,[3], ISO 19600 is ""based on the principles of good governance, proportionality, transparency and sustainability"".,[4],
,Like other related ISO standards, it emphasises the use of a ,Plan, Do, Check, Act, (PDCA) cycle.

,The legislative body of Colorado is the ,Colorado General Assembly, made up of two houses, the ,House of Representatives, and the ,Colorado Senate,.  Members of the House are elected for two year terms from single-member, equal population districts.  Approximately half of the members of the state senate are elected each two years to four year terms from single-member, equal population districts. The House of Representatives has 65 members and the Senate has 35 for a total of 100 legislators in Colorado.,[,citation needed,], The ,session laws, are published in the ,Session Laws of Colorado,.,[2], The laws of a general and permanent nature are ,codified, in the ,Colorado Revised Statutes, (C.R.S.).,[2],
,
,
,Direct democracy,[,edit,],
,In addition to providing for ,voting,,,[3],[4], the people of Colorado have reserved to themselves the:
,
,initiative, of laws,,[5],
,referendum, of other legislative acts,,[5], and,
,recall, of office holders.,[6],
,Judiciary,[,edit,],
,Main article: ,judiciary of Colorado,
,The ,judiciary of Colorado, is defined by Article VI of the ,Colorado Constitution, as well as the ,law of Colorado,. The administration of the state judicial system is the responsibility of the ,Chief Justice of the Colorado Supreme Court, as its executive head, and is assisted by several other commissions. Colorado courts include the:
,
,The Colorado Supreme Court courtroom in Denver,
,Colorado Supreme Court,,,
,Colorado Court of Appeals,,,
,Colorado district courts,,,
,Colorado county courts,,,
,Colorado water courts,,,
,Colorado municipal courts,.,
,All of the courts above, other than municipal courts and Denver's county court, are part of the state court system. In ,Denver,, county and municipal courts are integrated and are not part of the state court system for administrative purposes, and the Denver Probate Court and the Denver Juvenile Court have ,jurisdiction, over probate and juvenile matters, respectively. Outside Denver, these matters are within the jurisdiction of the district courts.
,Most crimes in Colorado are prosecuted by a ,district attorney,. One district attorney is elected for each of the state's 22 judicial districts in a partisan election. The ,state attorney general, also has power to prosecute certain crimes, and in rare circumstances a ,special prosecutor, may be appointed to prosecute a crime on a case by case basis. Municipal ordinance violations are prosecuted by ,city attorneys,.
,
,Local government,[,edit,],
,Main articles: ,List of counties in Colorado, and ,List of municipalities in Colorado,
,The ,Denver City and County Building,.,
,Colorado is divided into ,64 counties,. Counties are important units of government in Colorado since the state has no secondary civil subdivisions, such as ,townships,. Two of these counties, the ,City and County of Denver, and the ,City and County of Broomfield,, have ,consolidated city and county governments,. A municipality may extend into multiple counties.
,The ,272 Colorado municipalities, operate under one of five types of municipal governing authority:
,
,2 ,consolidated city and county governments,
,61 cities and 35 towns that are ,home rule municipalities,
,12 ,statutory cities,
,161 ,statutory towns,
,1 ,territorial charter municipality,
,There are no ,township, governments in Colorado, but there are more than 4,000 ,special districts,. See ,Active Colorado Local Governments,.
,Other political subdivisions include the ,University of Colorado Hospital Authority, which supports education, research, and public service activities, and which provides patient care through ,UCHealth, (University of Colorado Health).
,
,Other governments,[,edit,],
,There are two ,federally recognized tribes, in Colorado: the ,Southern Ute Indian Tribe, and the ,Ute Mountain Ute Tribe,.,[7], There are no other known ,state-recognized tribes,.

,2014 logo,
,A beta version of Zoom that could host conferences with only up to 15 video participants was launched on August 21, 2012.,[4], On January 25, 2013, version 1.0 of the program was released with an increase in the number of participants per conference to 25.,[5], By the end of its first month, Zoom had 400,000 users. By 2013, Zoom had more than one million users.,[6], After the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, by February 2020, Zoom had gained 2.22 million users in 2020 – more users than it amassed in the entirety of 2019.,[7],[8], In March 2020, the Zoom app was downloaded 2.13 million times.,[9],[10],
,During the ,COVID-19 pandemic,, there was a major increase in the use of Zoom for ,remote work,, ,distance education,,,[11], and online social relations.,[12], Zoom was one of the most downloaded mobile apps worldwide in 2020 with over 500 million downloads.,[13], 
,As of April 2020, Zoom had more than 300 million daily meeting participants (calculated as the number of times someone joins a meeting, which can happen multiple times per day).,[14],[15],
,
,Features,[,edit,],
,Zoom One has six tiers: Basic, Pro, Business, Business Plus, Enterprise, and Enterprise Plus.,[16],[17], Zoom is compatible with ,Windows,, ,macOS,, ,iOS,, ,Android,, ,ChromeOS,, and ,Linux,. It is noted for its simple interface and usability, regardless of technological expertise.,[18],[19], Features include one-on-one meetings, group video conferences, screen sharing, plugins, browser extensions, and the ability to record meetings and have them automatically transcribed.,[20], On some computers and operating systems, users are able to select a virtual background, which can be downloaded from different sites, to use as a backdrop behind themselves.,[21],
,Use of the platform is free for video conferences of up to 100 participants at once, with a 40-minute time limit. There is a 10-minute timeout period between free 40-minute meetings. For longer or larger conferences with more features, paid subscriptions are available. Features geared towards business conferences, such as Zoom Rooms, are also available.,[18],[21],[22], Up to 49 people can be seen on a ,desktop, or ,laptop, screen at once,,[23], up to 4 people per screen in ,iPhone, and ,Android, ,mobile phones, and ,tablet computers,, and up to 16 people per screen on ,iPad,. 
,Zoom security features include password-protected meetings, user authentication, waiting rooms, locked meetings, disabling participant screen sharing, randomly generated IDs, and the ability for the host to remove disruptive attendees.,[24], As of June 2020, Zoom began offering end-to-end encryption to business and enterprise users, with ,AES 256, ,GCM, encryption enabled for all users.,[25], In October 2020, Zoom added end-to-end encryption for free and paid users. It is available on all platforms, except for the official Zoom web client.,[26],[27],
,Zoom also offers a transcription service using ,Otter.ai, software that allows businesses to store transcriptions of the Zoom meetings online and search them, including separating and labeling different speakers.,[28],
,In July 2020, Zoom Rooms and Zoom Phone became available as ,hardware as a service, products.,[29], As of July 2022, Zoom Phone is available for domestic telephone service in 47 countries, and the company has sold 3 million seats for the service.,[30], Zoom for Home, a category of products designed for home use, became available in August 2020.,[31], Zoom Phone Provider Exchange, which gives customers options for voice services, reaches more than 70 countries.,[30], In July 2022, an option was added on Zoom Phone to turn on end-to-end encryption during one-on-one calls between users on the same company account.,[32], 
,In September 2020, Zoom added new accessibility features to make the app easier to use for those who are deaf, hard of hearing, or visually impaired. New features include the ability to move around video windows in gallery view, pin video windows to be spotlighted; improved keyboard shortcuts; new tools to adjust the size of closed captioning text; and sign language interpreters' windows can now sit directly next to the speaker.,[33],
,In October 2020 at Zoomtopia, Zoom's annual user conference, the company unveiled OnZoom, a virtual event marketplace with an integrated payment system where users can host and promote free or paid live events.,[34],[35], With OnZoom, users will be able to schedule and host one-time events or event series for up to 1,000 attendees and sell tickets online.,[36], The company also announced Zoom Apps, a feature integrating third-party apps so they can be used within the Zoom interface during meetings. The first such apps were expected to be available around the end of 2020, from companies including ,Slack,, ,Salesforce,, ,Dropbox,,,[34],[36], and ,Qatalog,. In October 2020, Zoom gave its users better security with an upgrade to end-to-end encryption for its online meetings network.,[37],
,Also in October 2020, Zoom signed a carrier agreement with ,Global BT Business,[38], to offer a fully managed Zoom Meetings service featuring a choice of connectivity and integration with its global voice network.,[39],
,In February 2021, Zoom added a ""virtual receptionist"" feature in the Kiosk Mode for Zoom Rooms. Created for in-person visitors to a business to interact in the lobby without physical contact.,[40],
,On March 22, 2021, Zoom announced that it would start selling its videoconferencing technology as a ,white-label product,, so other companies can embed it in their own products, with the calls running over Zoom but not carrying the company's brand name.,[41],
,In July 2021, Zoom released Zoom Apps which integrated a marketplace of third-party applications such as ,Dropbox Spaces,, ,Asana,, and ,SurveyMonkey,.,[42],
,In August 2021, Zoom launched Focus Mode, designed for use in educational settings.,[43],[44], When active, the mode will hide participants' screens from each other (though they can see each other's names) while the host retains the ability to see everyone's camera stream or screen share.,[45], The feature is available across all Zoom accounts, including free ones.,[46],[47],
,In September 2021 at Zoomtopia, the company announced that end-to-end encryption would now be available as an upgrade for Zoom Phone users. The company also announced Bring Your Own Key (BYOK) (for users to manage their own encryption keys that Zoom cannot access or see), Verified Identity (a multi-factor authentication feature working through ,Okta, that allows users to confirm the identity of meeting participants), and Video Engagement Center (for businesses to digitally interact with customers).,[48],[49], Other updates include revamped virtual whiteboard features, including touchscreen whiteboards that can be digitized for remote participants, and improved collaboration between Zoom Meetings and Zoom Chat.,[50],
,In October 2021, the option to automatically generate closed captions in English for Zoom meetings was expanded to all accounts, including free ones. The feature had previously only been available for Premium users.,[51],
,In April 2022, Zoom added features including gesture recognition, a virtual whiteboard, and Zoom IQ for sales.,[52],[53], In February 2022, the company launched Zoom Contact Center, a cloud contact center optimized for video calls and integrated directly into Zoom.,[54],
,In June 2022, Zoom One, which brings together chat, phone, whiteboard, and video conferencing capabilities into a single offering, was launched.,[17],[55], Also in June 2022, Zoom opened its Zoom Apps developer program to all developers, via Zoom Apps SDK.,[17], With the release of Zoom One, the company offers video conferencing translation and captioning for 11 languages: English, simplified Chinese, Dutch, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Russian, Spanish, and Ukrainian. This feature is available with the Business Plus and Enterprise Plus plans.,[55],
,
,Usage,[,edit,],
,In July 2020, using Zoom, the International Association of Constitutional Law and ,Alma Mater Europaea, organized the first round-the-clock and round-the-globe event that traveled through time zones.,
,Zoom is used by a variety of individuals and private and public organizations, including banks, schools,,[56], universities, healthcare providers, and government agencies,,[57],[58],[59],[60], and for ceremonies such as birthday parties,,[61], funeral services,,[62], and ,bar and bat mitzvah, services.,[63],[64], In 2020, Zoom formed a partnership with ,Formula One, to create a virtual club where fans can go behind the scenes and take part in virtual activities through Zoom, beginning with the ,Hungarian Grand Prix,.,[65],[66], An article published in July 2020 in the ,San Francisco Chronicle, noted a new real estate trend in San Francisco and Oakland where some listings include ""Zoom rooms"" with backdrops for Zoom calls.,[67],
,Richard Nelson,'s play ,What Do We Need to Talk About?, takes place on Zoom, with its main characters congregating online during the ,COVID-19 pandemic, using the platform. Written and directed by Nelson, it was commissioned by ,The Public Theater, and premiered on ,YouTube, on April 29, 2020, as a benefit performance. ,The New Yorker, called it ""the first great original play of quarantine"".,[68], ,Oprah's Your Life in Focus: A Vision Forward, was a live virtual experience hosted by ,Oprah Winfrey, on Zoom from May 16 through June 6, 2020.,[69], In Source Material's 2020 play, ,In These Uncertain Times,, directed by Samantha Shay, characters communicate on Zoom.,[70], The British ,found-footage, horror film ,Host,, directed by ,Rob Savage,, features a group of young people attempting to contact spirits through a remote séance on Zoom, and premiered on ,Shudder, in July 2020.,[71],[72], A live reading of ,Kristoffer Diaz,'s 2009 play ,The Elaborate Entrance of Chad Deity, over Zoom streamed on Play-PerView from August 15t to August 20, 2020.,[73],[74], In the 2021 film ,Locked Down,, directed by ,Doug Liman, and starring ,Anne Hathaway, and ,Chiwetel Ejiofor,, characters communicate through Zoom conferences.,[75],
,From July 3 to 4, 2020, the International Association of Constitutional Law and ,Alma Mater Europaea, used Zoom Webinar to conduct the first ""round-the-clock and round-the-globe"" event, featuring 52 speakers from 28 countries and several time zones.,[76],[77], Soon after, a format of conferences that ""virtually travel the globe with the sun from East to West"",,[78], became common, some of them running for several days.,[79],[80],[81],[82],
,On September 17, 2020, a live table read of the script for the 1982 film ,Fast Times at Ridgemont High, was hosted by ,Dane Cook,, with performers including ,Brad Pitt,, ,Jennifer Aniston,, ,Julia Roberts,, original cast member ,Sean Penn,, ,Matthew McConaughey,, ,Shia LaBeouf,, ,Morgan Freeman, (who served as the narrator), ,Jimmy Kimmel,, ,Ray Liotta,, and ,John Legend,, to raise money for the charity ,CORE,.,[83],[84], The broadcast of the ,72nd Primetime Emmy Awards, on September 20, 2020, hosted by Jimmy Kimmel, featured nominees participating through Zoom.,[85], On an alternate music video for the 2020 single "",Ice Cream,"" by ,Blackpink, featuring ,Selena Gomez,, the artists appeared via Zoom from their homes.,[86], The series ,Zoom Where It Happens,, airing on Zoom as a partnership between Zoom and Black female artists, launched in September 2020 with a virtual table read of an episode of ,The Golden Girls,, reimagined with an all-Black cast. The second episode featured an all-Black cast in a table read of an episode of ,Friends,, hosted by ,Gabrielle Union, and featuring ,Sterling K. Brown, and ,Uzo Aduba,.,[87],[88],
Familiarity with Zoom meetings in nation-state diplomatic and bureaucratic circles, partially due to the global ,COVID-19 pandemic,, substantially contributed to the efficacy of the Western response to the ,2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine,[89],
,
,Reception,[,edit,],
,Zoom has been criticized for ""security lapses and poor design choices"" that have resulted in heightened scrutiny of its software.,[90],[91], Many of Zoom's issues ""surround deliberate features designed to reduce friction in meetings"", which ,Citizen Lab, found to ""also, by design, reduce privacy or security"".,[92],[93], In March 2020, ,New York State Attorney General, ,Letitia James, launched an inquiry into Zoom's privacy and security practices.,[94], The inquiry was closed on May 7, 2020, with Zoom not admitting wrongdoing, but agreeing to take added security measures.,[95], In April 2020, CEO Yuan apologized for the security issues, stating that some of the issues were a result of Zoom's having been designed for ""large institutions with full IT support"".,[96], He noted that in December 2019, Zoom had a maximum of 10 million daily meeting participants, and in March 2020 the software had more than 200 million daily meeting participants, bringing the company increased challenges.,[97], Zoom agreed to focus on data privacy and issue a transparency report.,[98],[99],[100],[101], In April 2020, the company released Zoom version 5.0, which addressed a number of the security and privacy concerns. It includes passwords by default, improved encryption, and a new security icon for meetings.,[102], In September 2020, Zoom added support for ,two-factor authentication, to its desktop and mobile apps; the security feature was previously Web-only.,[103],
,As of April 2020, businesses, schools, and government entities who have restricted or prohibited the use of Zoom on their networks include ,Google,,,[104], ,Siemens,,,[105], the ,Australian Defence Force,, the ,German Ministry of Foreign Affairs,, the ,Indian Ministry of Home Affairs,, ,SpaceX,, and the ,New York City Department of Education,.,[106],[107], In May 2020, the New York City Department of Education lifted their ban on Zoom after the company addressed security and privacy concerns.,[108],
,By September 2020, Zoom had 370,200 institutional customers with more than 10 employees, up about 458 percent from the same quarter to the year before. The company's revenue rose 355 percent to $663.5 million, topping analysts' average estimate of $500.5 million. They were able to raise their annual revenue forecast by more than 30 percent after many of their free users converted to paid subscriptions.,[109],
,During the pandemic, Zoom's profit increased by 4,000%, and the company did not pay any income tax, according to a report by the ,Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy,.,[110],
,
,Privacy,[,edit,],
,Zoom has been criticized for its privacy and corporate data sharing policies, as well as for enabling video hosts to potentially violate the privacy of those participating in their calls.,[111],[112],[113],
,In March 2020, a ,Motherboard, article found that the company's ,iOS, app was sending device analytics data to ,Facebook, on startup, regardless of whether a Facebook account was being used with the service, and without disclosing it to the user.,[114], Zoom responded that it had been made aware of the issue and patched the app to remove the ,SDK, after learning that it was collecting unnecessary device data. The company stated that the SDK was only collecting information on the user's device specifications (such as model names and operating system versions) in order to optimize its service and that it was not collecting personal information.,[21],[115],[116], In the same month, Zoom was sued by a user in ,U.S. Federal Court, for illegally and secretly disclosing personal data to third parties, including Facebook.,[117], Zoom responded that it ""has never sold user data in the past and has no intention of selling users' data going forward"".,[118],
,In April 2020, a Zoom information gathering feature was found that automatically sent user names and email addresses to ,LinkedIn,, allowing some participants to surreptitiously access LinkedIn profile data about other users without their express consent.,[119], Soon after, the companies disabled their integration.,[120], In May 2020, the ,Federal Trade Commission, announced that it was looking into Zoom's privacy practices.,[121], The FTC alleged in a complaint,[122], that since at least 2016, ""Zoom maintained the cryptographic keys that could allow Zoom to access the content of its customers' meetings, did not provide advertised end-to-end encryption, falsely claimed ,HIPAA, compliance, installed the ZoomOpener webserver without adequate consent, did not uninstall the web server after uninstalling the Zoom App, and secured its Zoom Meetings with a lower level of encryption than promised."",[123], On November 9, 2020, a settlement was reached, requiring the company to stop misrepresenting security features, create an ,information security, program, obtain biannual assessments by a third party, and implement additional security measures.,[124],
,
,Security,[,edit,],
,Vulnerabilities,[,edit,],
,In November 2018, a security vulnerability was discovered that allowed a remote unauthenticated attacker to spoof ,UDP, messages that allowed the attacker to remove attendees from meetings, spoof messages from users, or hijack shared screens.,[125],[126], The company released fixes shortly after the vulnerability was discovered.,[127], In July 2019, security researcher Jonathan Leitschuh disclosed a ,zero-day, vulnerability allowing any website to force a ,macOS, user to join a Zoom call, with their ,video camera, activated, without the user's permission.,[128], Attempts to uninstall the Zoom client on macOS would prompt the software to re-install automatically in the background using a hidden web server that was set up on the machine during the first installation so that it remains active even after attempting to remove the client. After receiving public criticism, Zoom removed the vulnerability and the hidden webserver to allow complete uninstallation.,[129], In April 2020, security researchers found vulnerabilities where ,Windows, users' ,credentials, could be exposed.,[130],[131], Another vulnerability allowing unprompted access to cameras and microphones was made public.,[132],[133], Zoom issued a fix in April 2020.,[134], 
,Motherboard reported that there were two Zoom ,zero-days, for macOS and Windows respectively, selling for $500,000, on April 15, 2020.,[135], Security bug brokers were selling access to Zoom security flaws that could allow remote access into users' computers.,[19], Hackers also put up over 500,000 Zoom user names and passwords for sale on the ,dark web,.,[19], In response to the multitude of security and privacy issues found, Zoom began a comprehensive security plan, which included consulting with Luta Security, Trail of Bits, former ,Facebook, CSO ,Alex Stamos,, former ,Google, global lead of privacy technology Lea Kissner, BishopFox, the ,NCC Group,, and ,Johns Hopkins University, cryptographer ,Matthew D. Green,.,[136], 
,On April 20, 2020, the ,New York Times, reported that ,Dropbox, engineers had traced Zoom's security vulnerabilities back over two years, pushing Zoom to address such issues more quickly, and paying top hackers to find problems with Zoom's software. In the same article, the ,New York Times, noted that security researchers have praised Zoom for improving its response times, and for quickly patching recent bugs and removing features that could have privacy risks.,[19],[21], In a blog post on April 1, 2020, CEO Yuan announced a 90-day freeze on releasing new features, to focus on fixing privacy and security issues within the platform.,[137],  On July 1, 2020, at the end of the freeze, the company stated it had released 100 new safety features over the 90-day period. Those efforts include end-to-end encryption for all users, turning on meeting passwords by default, giving users the ability to choose which data centers calls are routed from, consulting with security experts, forming a CISO council, an improved bug bounty program, and working with third parties to help test security. Yuan also stated that Zoom would be sharing a transparency report later in 2020.,[138],[139],
,On November 16, 2020, Zoom announced a new security feature to combat disruptions during a session. The new feature was said to be a default for all free and paid users and made available on the Zoom clients for ,Mac,, PC, and ,Linux,, as well as Zoom mobile apps.,[140],
,On August 12, 2022, ,Wired magazine, reported on three separate security vulnerabilities discovered by security researcher Patrick Wardle affecting the Zoom ,Mac OS, desktop app. The vulnerabilities allowed an attacker who already had access to the Mac device to perform a ,privilege escalation, attack by installing malicious code using the app's auto-update feature, thereby giving them full control over the victim's device.,[141],
,
,Zoombombing,[,edit,],
,Further information: ,Zoombombing,
,"",Zoombombing,"" is a phenomenon where uninvited participants join a meeting to cause disruption.,[142],[143],[144], In July 2019, security researcher Sam Jadali uncovered the ,DataSpii, leak.,[145],[146], This catastrophic leak was facilitated by a marketing intelligence company known as Nacho Analytics (NA), which provided its members access to the URLs of real-time Zoom meetings of firms such as Oracle, Dell, Walmart, Uber, UCLA and Capital One.,[147],[148], NA's dissemination of meeting URLs enabled its members to Zoombomb these meetings. In April 2020, Zoom increased its default security settings to mitigate Zoombombing.,[18], The company also created a new ""report a user to Zoom"" button, intended to catch those behind Zoombombing attacks.,[149],
,
,Encryption practices,[,edit,],
,Zoom encrypts its public data streams, using ,TLS 1.2, with AES-256 (,Advanced Encryption Standard,) to protect ,signaling,, and AES-128 to protect ,streaming media,.,[150], Security researchers and reporters have criticized the company for its lack of transparency and poor encryption practices. Zoom initially claimed to use "",end-to-end encryption,"" in its marketing materials,,[151], but later clarified it meant ""from Zoom end point to Zoom end point"" (meaning effectively between Zoom servers and Zoom clients), which ,The Intercept, described as misleading and ""dishonest"".,[152], ,Alex Stamos,, a Zoom advisor who was formerly security chief at ,Facebook,, noted that a lack of end-to-end encryption is common in such products, as it is also true of ,Google Hangouts,, ,Microsoft Teams,, and ,Cisco Webex,.,[153], On May 7, 2020, Zoom announced that it had acquired ,Keybase,, a company specializing in end-to-end encryption, as part of an effort to strengthen its security practices moving forward.,[154],[155], Later that month, Zoom published a document for peer review, detailing its plans to ultimately bring end-to-end encryption to the software.,[156],
,In April 2020, Citizen Lab researchers discovered that a single, server-generated AES-128 key is being shared between all participants in ,ECB mode,, which is deprecated due to its pattern-preserving characteristics of the ciphertext.,[157], During test calls between participants in Canada and United States, the key was provisioned from servers located in mainland China where they are subject to the ,China Internet Security Law,.,[92],
,On June 3, 2020, Zoom announced that users on their free tier will not have access to ,end-to-end encryption, so that they could cooperate with the ,FBI, and law enforcement.,[158], Later, they said that they do not ""proactively monitor meeting content"".,[159], On June 17, 2020, the company reversed course and announced that free users would have access to end-to-end encryption after all.,[160],
,On September 7, 2020, cryptography researcher ,Nadim Kobeissi, accused Zoom's security team of failing to credit his open-source protocol analysis research software, Verifpal, with being instrumental during the design phase of Zoom's new encryption protocol, as described in their whitepaper published in June 2020.,[161], Kobeissi published a week's worth of conversations with Zoom's security leadership in support of his claim, including Max Krohn, which included eight Verifpal models that Zoom's team asked for feedback on, promises of a citation to credit Kobeissi for his contributions and an admission that the Verifpal citation was pulled from the whitepaper at the last moment for unspecified reasons. Kobeissi also linked to a tweet by Zoom security consultant Lea Kissner which he described as a public ,character assassination, attempt issued in response to his repeated requests to have his work cited in the research paper published by Zoom.,[162],
,
,Data routing,[,edit,],
,Zoom admitted that some calls in early April 2020 and prior were mistakenly routed through servers in ,mainland China,, prompting some governments and businesses to cease their usage of Zoom.,[163], The company later announced that data of free users outside of China would ""never be routed through China"" and that paid subscribers will be able to customize which data center regions they want to use. The company has data centers in Europe, Asia, North America, and Latin America.,[164],[165],
,
,Regulatory issues,[,edit,],
,In August 2021, the Data Protection regulatory body in Hamburg, Germany, ruled that Zoom was operating in the ,European Union, in breach of the ,General Data Protection Regulation, (GDPR). This is due to the fact that, as per the ,Schrems II, ruling, data that is being transferred out of the EU must be given the same protections that provided by the GDPR. The data gathered by Zoom was being sent to the United States.,[166],

,Example of a Business Process Model and Notation for a process with a normal flow,
,Business Process Model and Notation, (,BPMN,) is a ,graphical representation, for specifying ,business processes, in a ,business process model,.
,Originally developed by the ,Business Process Management Initiative, (BPMI), BPMN has been maintained by the ,Object Management Group, (OMG) since the two organizations merged in 2005. Version 2.0 of BPMN was released in January 2011,,[1], at which point the name was amended to ,Business Process Model ,and, Notation, to reflect the introduction of execution semantics, which  were introduced alongside the existing notational and diagramming elements. Though it is an OMG specification, BPMN is also ratified as ,ISO, 19510. The latest version is BPMN 2.0.2, published in January 2014.,[2],
,
,
,Overview,[,edit,],
,Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) is a standard for ,business process modeling, that provides a graphical notation for specifying ,business processes, in a ,Business Process Diagram, (BPD),,[3], based on a ,flowcharting, technique very similar to ,activity diagrams, from ,Unified Modeling Language, (UML).,[4], The objective of BPMN is to support ,business process management,, for both technical users and business users, by providing a notation that is intuitive to business users, yet able to represent complex process semantics. The BPMN specification also provides a mapping between the graphics of the notation and the underlying constructs of execution languages, particularly ,Business Process Execution Language, (BPEL).,[5],
,BPMN has been designed to provide a standard notation readily understandable by all business stakeholders, typically including business analysts, technical developers and business managers. BPMN can therefore be used to support the generally desirable aim of all stakeholders on a project adopting a common language to describe processes, helping to avoid communication gaps that can arise between ,business process design, and implementation.
,BPMN is one of a number of business process modeling language standards used by modeling tools and processes. While the current variety of languages may suit different modeling environments, there are those who advocate for the development or emergence of a single, comprehensive standard, combining the strengths of different existing languages. It is suggested that in time, this could help to unify the expression of basic business process concepts (e.g., public and private processes, choreographies), as well as advanced process concepts (e.g., exception handling, transaction compensation).
,Two new standards, using a similar approach to BPMN have been developed, addressing case management modeling (,Case Management Model and Notation,) and ,decision modeling, (,Decision Model and Notation,).
,
,Topics,[,edit,],
,Scope,[,edit,],
,BPMN is constrained to support only the concepts of modeling applicable to business processes. Other types of modeling done by organizations for non-process purposes are out of scope for BPMN. Examples of modeling excluded from BPMN are:
,
,Organizational structures,
,Functional breakdowns,
,Data models,[6],
,In addition, while BPMN shows the flow of data (messages), and the association of data artifacts to activities, it is not a ,data flow diagram,.
,
,Elements,[,edit,],
,BPMN models are expressed by simple diagrams constructed from a limited set of graphical elements. For both business users and developers, they simplify understanding of business activities' flow and process.
BPMN's four basic element categories are:
,
,Flow objects,
,Events, activities, gateways,
,Connecting objects,
,Sequence flow, message flow, association,
,Swim lanes,
,Pool, lane, Dark Pool,

,
,Flow objects, are the main describing elements within BPMN, and consist of three core elements: events, activities, and gateways.
,
,Event,[,edit,],
,An Event is represented with a circle and denotes something that ,happens, (compared with an activity, which is something that is ,done,). Icons within the circle denote the type of event (e.g., an envelope representing a message, or a clock representing time). Events are also classified as ,Catching, (for example, if catching an incoming message starts a process) or ,Throwing, (such as throwing a completion message when a process ends).
,Start event,
,Acts as a process trigger; indicated by a single narrow border, and can only be ,Catch,, so is shown with an open (outline) icon.,
,Intermediate event,
,Represents something that happens between the start and end events; is indicated by a double border, and can ,Throw, or ,Catch, (using solid or open icons as appropriate). For example, a task could flow to an event that throws a message across to another pool, where a subsequent event waits to catch the response before continuing.,
,End event,
,Represents the result of a process; indicated by a single thick or bold border, and can only ,Throw,, so is shown with a solid icon.,
,Activity,[,edit,],
,An activity is represented with a rounded-corner rectangle and describes the kind of work which must be done. An activity is a generic term for work that a company performs.  It can be atomic or compound.
,Task,
,A task represents a single unit of work that is not or cannot be broken down to a further level of business process detail.  It is referred to as an atomic activity.  A task is the lowest level activity illustrated on a process diagram.  A set of tasks may represent a high-level procedure.,
,Sub-process,
,Used to hide or reveal additional levels of business process detail. When collapsed, a sub-process is indicated by a plus sign against the bottom line of the rectangle; when expanded, the rounded rectangle expands to show all flow objects, connecting objects, and artifacts.  A sub-process is referred to as a compound activity.,
,Has its own self-contained start and end events; sequence flows from the ,parent, process must not cross the boundary.,
,Transaction,
,A form of sub-process in which all contained activities must be treated as a whole; i.e., they must all be completed to meet an objective, and if any one of them fails, they must all be compensated (undone). Transactions are differentiated from expanded sub-processes by being surrounded by a double border.,
,Call Activity,
,A point in the process where a global process or a global Task is reused. A call activity is differentiated from other activity types by a bolded border around the activity area.,
,Gateway,[,edit,],
,A gateway is represented with a diamond shape and determines forking and merging of paths, depending on the conditions expressed.
,Exclusive,
,Used to create alternative flows in a process. Because only one of the paths can be taken, it is called exclusive.,
,Event Based,
,The condition determining the path of a process is based on an evaluated event.,
,Parallel,
,Used to create parallel paths without evaluating any conditions.,
,Inclusive,
,Used to create alternative flows where all paths are evaluated.,
,Exclusive Event Based,
,An event is being evaluated to determine which of mutually exclusive paths will be taken.,
,Complex,
,Used to model complex synchronization behavior.,
,Parallel Event Based,
,Two parallel processes are started based on an event, but there is no evaluation of the event.,
,Connections,[,edit,],
,Flow objects, are connected to each other using ,Connecting objects,, which are of three types: sequences, messages, and associations.
,
,Sequence Flow,
,A Sequence Flow is represented with a solid line and arrowhead, and shows in which order the activities are performed. The ,sequence flow, may also have a symbol at its start, a small diamond indicates one of a number of ,conditional flows, from an activity, while a diagonal slash indicates the ,default flow, from a decision or activity with conditional flows.,
,Message Flow,
,A Message Flow is represented with a dashed line, an open circle at the start, and an open arrowhead at the end. It tells us what messages flow across organizational boundaries (i.e., between pools). A message flow can never be used to connect activities or events within the same pool.,
,Association,
,An Association is represented with a dotted line. It is used to associate an Artifact or text to a Flow Object, and can indicate some directionality using an open arrowhead (toward the artifact to represent a result, from the artifact to represent an input, and both to indicate it is read and updated). No directionality is used when the Artifact or text is associated with a sequence or message flow (as that flow already shows the direction).,

			,Annotation,
		,
,
,Swim lanes, are a visual mechanism of organising and categorising activities, based on ,cross functional flowcharting,, and in BPMN consist of two types:
,
,Pool,
,Represents major participants in a process, typically separating different organisations. A pool contains one or more lanes (like a real swimming pool). A pool can be open (i.e., showing internal detail) when it is depicted as a large rectangle showing one or more lanes, or collapsed (i.e., hiding internal detail) when it is depicted as an empty rectangle stretching the width or height of the diagram.,
,Lane,
,Used to organise and categorise activities within a pool according to function or role, and depicted as a rectangle stretching the width or height of the pool. A lane contains the flow objects, connecting objects and artifacts.,
,Artifacts, allow developers to bring some more information into the model/diagram. In this way the model/diagram becomes more readable. There are three pre-defined Artifacts, and they are:
,
,Data objects: Data objects show the reader which data is required or produced in an activity.,
,Group: A Group is represented with a rounded-corner rectangle and dashed lines. The group is used to group different activities but does not affect the flow in the diagram.,
,Annotation: An annotation is used to give the reader of the model/diagram an understandable impression.,

,BPMN 2.0.2,[,edit,],
,The vision of BPMN 2.0.2 is to have one single specification for a new Business Process Model and Notation that defines the notation, metamodel and interchange format but with a modified name that still preserves the ""BPMN"" brand. The features include:
,
,Formalizes the execution semantics for all BPMN elements.,
,Defines an extensibility mechanism for both Process model extensions and graphical extensions.,
,Refines Event composition and correlation.,
,Extends the definition of human interactions.,
,Defines a Choreography model.,
,The current version of the specification was released in January 2014.,[1],

,Major changes
,
,—
,
,
,The new specification introduces a categorization of event triggers into ""catching"" and ""throwing"" events. I.e. there are two kinds of intermediate message events now – one kind responsible for reception of messages (""catching"") and one kind responsible for sending messages (""throwing"").,
,In addition to the old types, it introduces a new type, the ,signal event,.,
,Start and end link events do not exist any longer in BPMN 1.1.,
,The old ""rule events"" were renamed to ,conditional events,. The semantics and appearance have not changed.,
,The event-based gateway in BPMN 1.1 looks slightly different from what it looked like in 1.0. Instead of the hexagonal star it now has a pentagon in its center. The same shape is also used for the multiple events (start, intermediate, end).,
,There is an additional line separating your lane's description from its content.,
,
,
,The BPMN 1.2 minor revision changes consist of editorial corrections and implementation bug fixes. Consequently, these minor changes affect modeling tool vendors more than modelers (users).,[7],

,Types of BPMN sub-model,[,edit,],
,Business process modeling is used to communicate a wide variety of information to a wide variety of audiences. BPMN is designed to cover this wide range of usage and allows modeling of end-to-end business processes to allow the viewer of the Diagram to be able to easily differentiate between sections of a BPMN Diagram. There are three basic types of sub-models within an end-to-end BPMN model: Private (internal) business processes, Abstract (public) processes, and Collaboration (global) processes:
,
,Private (internal) business processes,
,Private business processes are those internal to a specific organization and are the type of processes that have been generally called ,workflow, or BPM processes. If swim lanes are used then a private business process will be contained within a single Pool. The Sequence Flow of the Process is therefore contained within the Pool and cannot cross the boundaries of the Pool. Message Flow can cross the Pool boundary to show the ,interactions, that exist between separate private business processes.,
,Abstract (public) processes,
,This represents the interactions between a private business process and another process or participant. Only those activities that communicate outside the private business process are included in the abstract process. All other “internal” activities of the private business process are not shown in the abstract process. Thus, the abstract process shows to the outside world the sequence of messages that are required to interact with that business process. Abstract processes are contained within a Pool and can be modeled separately or within a larger BPMN Diagram to show the Message Flow between the abstract process activities and other entities. If the abstract process is in the same Diagram as its corresponding private business process, then the activities that are common to both processes can be associated.,
,Collaboration (global) processes,
,A collaboration process depicts the interactions between two or more business entities. These interactions are defined as a sequence of activities that represent the message exchange patterns between the entities involved. Collaboration processes may be contained within a Pool and the different participant business interactions are shown as Lanes within the Pool. In this situation, each Lane would represent two participants and a direction of travel between them. They may also be shown as two or more Abstract Processes interacting through Message Flow (as described in the previous section). These processes can be modeled separately or within a larger BPMN Diagram to show the Associations between the collaboration process activities and other entities. If the collaboration process is in the same Diagram as one of its corresponding private business process, then the activities that are common to both processes can be associated.,
,Within and between these three BPMN sub-models, many types of Diagrams can be created. The following are the types of business processes that can be modeled with BPMN (those with asterisks may not map to an executable language):
,
,High-level private process activities (not functional breakdown)*,
,Detailed private business process,
,As-is or old business process*,
,To-be or new business process,
,Detailed private business process with interactions to one or more external entities (or “Black Box” processes),
,Two or more detailed private business processes interacting,
,Detailed private business process relationship to Abstract Process,
,Detailed private business process relationship to Collaboration Process,
,Two or more Abstract Processes*,
,Abstract Process relationship to Collaboration Process*,
,Collaboration Process only (e.g., ebXML BPSS or RosettaNet)*,
,Two or more detailed private business processes interacting through their Abstract Processes and/or a Collaboration Process,
,BPMN is designed to allow all the above types of Diagrams. However, it should be cautioned that if too many types of sub-models are combined, such as three or more private processes with message flow between each of them, then the Diagram may become difficult to understand. Thus, the OMG recommends that the modeler pick a focused purpose for the BPD, such as a private or collaboration process.
,
,Comparison with other process modeling notations,[,edit,],
,Event-driven process chains, (EPC) and BPMN are two notations with similar expressivity when ,process modeling, is concerned.,[8], A BPMN model can be transformed into an EPC model. Conversely, an EPC model can be transformed into a BPMN model with only a slight loss of information.,[9], A study showed that for the same process, the BPMN model may need around 40% fewer elements than the corresponding EPC model, but with a slightly larger set of symbols.  The BPMN model would therefore be easier to read.  The conversion between the two notations can be automated.,[10],
,UML activity diagrams, and BPMN are two notations that can be used to model the same processes: a subset of the activity diagram elements have a similar semantic than BPMN elements, despite the smaller and less expressive set of symbols.,[11], A study showed that both types of process models appear to have the same level of readability for inexperienced users, despite the higher formal constraints of an activity diagram.
,
,BPM Certifications,[,edit,],
,The Business Process Management (BPM) world acknowledges the critical importance of modeling standards for optimizing and standardizing business processes. The Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) version 2 has brought significant improvements in event and subprocess modeling, significantly enriching the capabilities for documenting, analyzing, and optimizing business processes.
,Elemate positions itself as a guide in exploring the various BPM certifications and dedicated training paths, thereby facilitating the mastery of BPMN and continuous improvement of processes within companies.
,
,OMG OCEB certification,[,edit,],
,The Object Management Group (OMG), the international consortium behind the BPMN standard, offers the OCEB certification (OMG Certified Expert in BPM). This certification specifically targets business process modeling with particular emphasis on BPMN 2. The OCEB certification is structured into five levels: Fundamental, Business Intermediate (BUS INT), Technical Intermediate (TECH INT), Business Advanced (BUS ADV), and Technical Advanced (TECH ADV), thus providing a comprehensive pathway for BPM professionals.
,
,Other BPM certifications,[,edit,],
,Beyond the OCEB, there are other recognized certifications in the BPM field:
,
,CBPA (Certified Business Process Associate): Offered by the ABPMP (Association of Business Process Management Professionals), this certification is aimed at professionals starting in BPM.,
,CBPP (Certified Business Process Professional): Also awarded by the ABPMP, the CBPP certification targets experienced professionals, offering validation of their global expertise in BPM.,
,The interest of a BPMN certification,[,edit,],
,While BPMN 2 has established itself as an essential standard in business process modeling, a specific certification for BPMN could provide an additional guarantee regarding the quality and compliance of the models used. This becomes particularly relevant when companies employ external providers for the modeling of their business processes.
,
,BPM certifying training with BPMN 2,[,edit,],
,Although OMG does not offer a certification exclusively dedicated to BPMN 2, various organizations provide certifying training that encompasses this standard. These trainings cover not just BPMN but also the principles of management, automation, and digitization of business processes. They enable learners to master process mapping and modeling using BPMN 2, essential for optimizing business operations.,[12],

,The ,Object Constraint Language, (,OCL,) is a ,declarative language, describing rules applying to ,Unified Modeling Language, (UML) models developed at ,IBM, and is now part of the UML standard. Initially, OCL was merely a formal specification language extension for UML.,[1], OCL may now be used with any ,Meta-Object Facility, (MOF) ,Object Management Group, (OMG) ,meta-model,, including UML.,[2], The Object Constraint Language is a precise text language that provides constraint and object query expressions on any MOF model or meta-model that cannot otherwise be expressed by diagrammatic notation. OCL is a key component of the new OMG standard recommendation for transforming models, the Queries/Views/Transformations (,QVT,) specification.
,
,
,Description,[,edit,],
,OCL is a descendant of ,Syntropy,, a second-generation object-oriented analysis and design method. The OCL 1.4 definition specified a constraint language. In OCL 2.0, the definition has been extended to include general object query language definitions.
,OCL statements are constructed in four parts:
,
,a context that defines the limited situation in which the statement is valid,
,a property that represents some characteristics of the context (e.g., if the context is a class, a property might be an attribute),
,an operation (e.g., arithmetic, set-oriented) that manipulates or qualifies a property, and,
,keywords (e.g., if, then, else, and, or, not, implies) that are used to specify conditional expressions.,
,Relation,[,edit,],
,OCL and UML,[,edit,],
,OCL supplements ,UML, by providing expressions that have neither the ambiguities of natural language nor the inherent difficulty of using complex mathematics. OCL is also a navigation language for graph-based models.
,
,OCL and MOF,[,edit,],
,OCL makes a ,Meta-Object Facility, model more precise by associating assertions with its meta-elements.
,
,OCL and QVT,[,edit,],
,Of particular importance to ,Model Driven Engineering, (MDE) or ,model-driven architecture, is the notion of ,Model transformation,. The ,OMG, has defined a specific standard for model transformation called ,MOF/QVT, or in short ,QVT,. Several model transformation languages like ,GReAT,, ,VIATRA,, or ,Tefkat, are presently available, with different levels of compliance with the QVT standard. Many of these languages are built on top of OCL, which is the main part of the ,QVT,-compliance.
,
,Alternatives,[,edit,],
,Being a rule-based validation language, ,Schematron, may be considered an alternative to OCL. However Schematron works for Extensible Markup Language ,(XML) trees, while OCL makes it possible to navigate ,MOF,-based models and meta-models (i.e. XML Metadata Interchange (,XMI,) trees). In other words, OCL relates to ,UML, or MOF similarly to how Schematron relates to ,XML,. (Note that Schematron uses ,XPath, to navigate inside the XML trees.),Being a model specification language permitting designers to decorate a model or a meta-model with side-effect-free annotations, OCL could be replaced by languages like ,Alloy,. Automated OCL generation is in principle possible from natural language.,[3],

,Eclipse OCL ,[4], extends Standard OCL with additional operators and a type for Maps. AgileUML extends Standard OCL with Map and Function types.,[5], These extensions are consistent with the map and function types present in modern programming languages such as Python and Swift.

,The geography of the ,U.S., ,State of Colorado, is diverse, encompassing both rugged mountainous terrain, vast plains, desert lands, desert canyons, and ,mesas,. Colorado is a landlocked U.S. state. In 1861, the ,United States Congress, defined the boundaries of the new ,Territory of Colorado, exclusively by lines of ,latitude, and ,longitude,, stretching from ,37°N, to ,41°N, latitude, and from ,102°02'48""W, to ,109°02'48""W, longitude (,25°W, to ,32°W, from the ,Washington Meridian,).,[1], Starting in 1868, official surveys demarcated the boundaries,  deviating from the parallels and meridians in several places. Later surveys attempted to correct some of these mistakes but in 1925 the ,U.S. Supreme Court, affirmed that the earlier demarcation was the official boundary.,[2], The borders of Colorado are now officially defined by 697 ,boundary markers, connected by ,straight boundary lines,.,[3],  Colorado, ,Wyoming,, and ,Utah, are the only states that have their borders defined solely by straight boundary lines with no natural features.,[4],  The southwest corner of Colorado is the ,Four Corners Monument, at ,36°59'56""N,, ,109°2'43""W,.,[5],[6],  This is the only place in the United States where four states meet: Colorado, ,New Mexico,, ,Arizona,, and Utah.,[4],
,The summit of ,Mount Elbert, at 14,440 feet (4,401.2 m) elevation in ,Lake County, is the state's highest point and the highest point in the ,Rocky Mountains, of ,North America,.,[7], Colorado has approximately 550 mountain peaks that exceed 10,000 feet (4,000 metres) elevation. The state's lowest elevation is 3,317 feet (1,011 m) at the point on the eastern boundary of ,Yuma County, where the ,Arikaree River, flows into the ,state of Kansas,.,[8], This is the highest low point of any state, and Colorado and Wyoming are the only two states that lie entirely above 3000 feet (1000 m) elevation.,[9],
,As is common in mountainous and adjacent areas, ,microclimates, exist and weather is strongly influenced by ,orography,. A notable regional atmospheric phenomenon is the ,Denver Convergence Vorticity Zone, (DCVZ) and related Denver Cyclone occurring on the High Plains just east of ,Denver,. The Rocky Mountains as a whole induce significant changes in weather afar, such as the ,Colorado low,.
,
,
,Regions,[,edit,],
,Rocky Mountain National Park,
,To the east of the Rocky Mountains in Colorado are the ,Colorado Eastern Plains,/,High Plains,, the section of the ,Great Plains, within Colorado at elevations ranging from 3,500 to 7,000 feet (1,100 to 2,100 metres). The ,Midwest, states of Kansas and ,Nebraska, border Colorado to the east and northeast.
,The plains are sparsely settled with most population along the ,South Platte, and the ,Arkansas, rivers. Rainfall is meager, averaging about 15 inches (380 mm) annually. There is some irrigated farming, but much of the land is used for ,dryland farming, or ,ranching,. ,Winter wheat, is a typical crop and most small towns in the region boast both a ,water tower, and a ,grain elevator,.
,The bulk of Colorado's population lives along the eastern edge of the Rocky Mountains in the ,Front Range Urban Corridor,. This region is partially protected from prevailing storms by the high mountains to the west.
,
,Snowpack accumulation at 14,255 ft (4,345 m) on Longs Peak in Rocky Mountain National Park,
,To the west lies the eastern slope of the ,Rocky Mountains, with notable peaks such as ,Longs Peak,, ,Mount Blue Sky,, ,Pikes Peak,, and the ,Spanish Peaks, near ,Walsenburg, in the south. This area drains to the east, is forested, and partially urbanized. With urbanization, utilization of the forest for timbering and grazing resulted in accumulation of fuel. During the drought of 2002 devastating ,forest fires, swept this area.
,The ,Continental Divide, stretches along the crest of the Rocky Mountains. To the west of the Continental Divide is the ,Western Slope,. Water west of the Continental Divide drains west into the ,Pacific Ocean, via the ,Colorado River,. Western Colorado is made up of mountains, mesas, desert canyons, and desert lands.
,Within the interior of the Rocky Mountains are several large parks or high broad basins. In the north, on the east side of the Continental Divide is ,North Park,. North Park is drained by the ,North Platte River,, which flows north into the ,northwest, state of Wyoming. Just south but on the west side of the Continental Divide is ,Middle Park,, drained by the Colorado River. ,South Park, is the ,headwaters, of the South Platte River. To the south lies the ,San Luis Valley,, the headwaters of the ,Rio Grande,, which drains into New Mexico. Across the ,Sangre de Cristo Range, to the east of the San Luis Valley lies the ,Wet Mountain Valley,. These basins, particularly the San Luis Valley, lie along the ,Rio Grande Rift,, a major tectonic feature. See ,Rift,.
,The Rocky Mountains within Colorado contain 54 peaks that are 14,000 ft (4,300 m) or higher, known as ,fourteeners,.,[10], The mountains are timbered with ,conifers, and ,aspen, to the ,tree line,, at an elevation of about 12,000 ft (3,700 m) in southern Colorado to about 10,500 ft (3,200 m) in northern Colorado; above this only alpine vegetation grows. The Rockies are snow-covered only in the winter; most snow melts by mid-August with the exception of a few small glaciers. The ,Colorado Mineral Belt,, stretching from the ,San Juan Mountains, in the southwest to ,Boulder, and ,Central City, on the front range, contains most of the historic gold and silver ,mining districts, of Colorado.
,
,Sagebrush Shrubland is typical of Northwestern Colorado. This ecosystem dominates here in Wolf Creek Wildlife Management Area, near Massadona, CO.,
,The Western Slope is generally drained by the Colorado River and its tributaries. Notable to the south are the ,San Juan Mountains,, an extremely rugged mountain range, and to the west of the San Juans, the ,Colorado Plateau,, a high desert extending into neighboring states. ,Grand Junction, is the largest city on the Western Slope. Grand Junction is served by ,Interstate Highway 70,. To the southeast of Grand Junction is ,Grand Mesa,, a large flat-topped desert mountain. Further east are the ,ski resort, communities of ,Aspen,, ,Vail,, ,Crested Butte,, and ,Steamboat Springs,. The northwestern corner of Colorado bordering Northern Utah and Western Wyoming is mostly sparsely populated rangeland.
,From west to east, the state consists of desert basins, desert canyons and mesas, turning into desert plateaus, then alpine mountains, and then the grasslands of the High Plains. Mount Elbert is the highest peak in the Rocky Mountains of North America. The famous ,Pikes Peak, is just west of ,Colorado Springs,. Its lone peak is visible from near the Kansas border on clear days.

,Microsoft Defender Antivirus, (formerly ,Windows Defender,) is an ,antivirus software, component of ,Microsoft Windows,. It was first released as a downloadable free anti-spyware program for ,Windows XP, and was shipped with ,Windows Vista, and ,Windows 7,. It has evolved into a full antivirus program, replacing ,Microsoft Security Essentials, in ,Windows 8, or later versions.,[3],
,In March 2019, Microsoft announced Microsoft Defender ATP for Mac for business customers to protect their ,Mac,[4], devices from attacks on a corporate network, and a year later, to expand protection for mobile devices, it announced Microsoft Defender ATP for ,Android,[5], and ,iOS,[6], devices, which incorporates ,Microsoft SmartScreen,, a ,firewall,, and ,malware, scanning. The mobile version of Microsoft Defender also includes a feature to block access to corporate data if it detects a malicious app is installed.
,
,
,Microsoft Defender brand,[,edit,],
,As of 2021, Microsoft Defender Antivirus is part of the much larger Microsoft Defender brand, which includes several other software and service offerings, including:
,
,Microsoft Defender XDR (formerly 365 Defender),[7],
,Microsoft Defender for Cloud,[8],
,Microsoft Defender Endpoint,[9],
,Microsoft Defender for Office 365,[10],
,Microsoft Defender for Identity,[11],
,Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps,[12],
,Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management,[13],
,Microsoft Defender for Threat Intelligence,[14],
,Microsoft Defender for Individuals,[15],
,Features,[,edit,],
,Microsoft Defender Antivirus provides several key features to protect endpoints from computer virus. In Windows 10, Windows Defender settings are controlled in the ,Windows Defender Security Center,. ,Windows 10 Anniversary Update, includes several improvements, including a new popup that announces the results of a scan.,[16],
,
,Real-time protection,[,edit,],
,Windows Defender real-time notification,
,In the Windows Defender options, the user can configure ,real-time protection, options. Windows 10's Anniversary Update introduced Limited Periodic Scanning, which optionally allows Windows Defender to scan a system periodically if another antivirus app is installed.,[16], It also introduced Block at First Sight, which uses machine learning to predict whether a file is malicious.,[17],
,
,
,Browser integration,[,edit,],
,Demonstration of Microsoft Defender Browser Protection on Chrome. Pictured here is the warning that the website in question ""has been reported as unsafe"".,
,Integration with ,Internet Explorer, and ,Microsoft Edge, enables files to be scanned as they are downloaded to detect malicious software inadvertently downloaded. As of April 2018, Microsoft Defender is also available for ,Google Chrome, via an extension,[18], and works in conjunction with ,Google Safe Browsing,, but as of late 2022, this extension is now deprecated.,[19],
,
,
,Application Guard,[,edit,],
,A feature released in early 2018, Windows Defender Application Guard is a feature exclusive to Microsoft Edge that allows users to ,sandbox, their current browsing session from the system. This prevents a malicious website or ,malware, from affecting the system and the browser. Application Guard is a feature only available on Windows 10 Pro and Enterprise. In May 2019, Microsoft announced Application Guard for Google Chrome and ,Firefox,. The extension, once installed, will open the current tabs web page in Microsoft Edge with Application Guard enabled.
,
,
,Controlled Folder Access,[,edit,],
,A notification showing Microsoft Defender has blocked access to a protected folder.,
,Controlled Folder Access is a feature introduced with Windows 10 Fall Creators Update to protect a user's important files from the growing threat of ,ransomware,. This feature was released about a year later after the ,Petya, family of ransomware first appeared. The feature will notify the user every time a program tries to access these folders and will be blocked unless given access via the user. Windows will warn the user with a ,User Account Control, popup as a final warning if they opt to ""Allow"" a program to read Controlled Folders.
,
,
,History,[,edit,],
,Microsoft AntiSpyware (Beta 1),[,edit,],
,Microsoft AntiSpyware Beta 1 (Version 1.0.701) running on ,Windows XP,
,Windows Defender was initially based on GIANT AntiSpyware, formerly developed by GIANT Company Software, Inc.,[20], The company's acquisition was announced by Microsoft on December 16, 2004.,[21],[22], While the original GIANT AntiSpyware officially supported older Windows versions, support for the ,Windows 9x, line of operating systems was later dropped by Microsoft.
,The first ,beta, release of ,Microsoft AntiSpyware, from January 6, 2005, was a repackaged version of GIANT AntiSpyware.,[21], There were more builds released in 2005, with the last Beta 1 refresh released on November 21, 2005.
,At the 2005 ,RSA Security, conference, ,Bill Gates,, the Chief Software Architect and co-founder of Microsoft, announced that Microsoft AntiSpyware would be made available free-of-charge to users with validly licensed ,Windows 2000,, ,Windows XP,, and ,Windows Server 2003, operating systems to secure their systems against the increasing malware threat.,[23],

,Windows Defender (Beta 2),[,edit,],
,On November 4, 2005, it was announced that Microsoft AntiSpyware was renamed to ,Windows Defender,.,[24],[25], Windows Defender (Beta 2) was released on February 13, 2006. It featured the program's new name and a redesigned user interface. The core engine was rewritten in ,C++,, unlike the original GIANT-developed AntiSpyware, which was written in ,Visual Basic,.,[26], This improved the application's performance. Also, since Beta 2, the program works as a Windows service, unlike earlier releases, which enables the application to protect the system even when a user is not logged on. Beta 2 also requires ,Windows Genuine Advantage, (WGA) validation. However, Windows Defender (Beta 2) did not contain some of the tools found in Microsoft AntiSpyware (Beta 1). Microsoft removed the ,System Inoculation,, ,Secure Shredder, and ,System Explorer, tools found in MSAS (Beta 1) as well as the ,Tracks Eraser, tool, which allowed users to easily delete many different types of temporary files related to ,Internet Explorer 6,, including ,HTTP cookies,, ,web cache,, and ,Windows Media Player, playback history.,[21], German and Japanese versions of Windows Defender (Beta 2) were later released by Microsoft.,[27],[28],
,
,Windows Defender - Release,[,edit,],
,On October 23, 2006, Microsoft ,released, the final version of Windows Defender.,[29], It supports Windows XP and Windows Server 2003; however, unlike the betas, it doesn't run on Windows 2000.,[30], Some of the key differences from the beta version are improved detection, redesigned user interface and delivery of definition updates via ,Automatic Updates,.,[31],
,Windows Defender includes has the ability to remove installed ,ActiveX, software.,[32], WindowsDefender featured an integrated support for ,Microsoft SpyNet, that allows users to report to Microsoft what they consider to be spyware,,[,citation needed,], and what applications and device drivers they allow to be installed on their systems.
,
,Windows Defender - Windows Vista,[,edit,],
,Windows Vista included several security functionalities related to the Windows Defender. Some of the functionality  was removed in subsequent versions of Windows.,[33],
,
,Security agents,[,edit,],
,Security agents which monitor the computer for malicious activities:
,
,Auto Start, – Monitors lists of programs that are allowed to automatically run when the user starts the computer,
,System Configuration (settings), – Monitors security-related settings in Windows,
,Internet Explorer Add-ons, – Monitors programs that automatically run when the user starts Internet Explorer,
,Internet Explorer Configurations (settings), – Monitors browser security settings,
,Internet Explorer Downloads, – Monitors files and programs that are designed to work with Internet Explorer,
,Services and Drivers, – Monitors services and drivers as they interact with Windows and programs,
,Application Execution, – Monitors when programs start and any operations they perform while running,
,Application Registration, – Monitors tools and files in the operating system where programs can register to run at any time,
,Windows Add-ons, – Monitors add-on programs for Windows,
,Software Explorer,[,edit,],
,The ,Advanced Tools, section allows users to discover potential vulnerabilities with a series of Software Explorers. They provide views of startup programs, currently running software, network connected applications, and ,Winsock, providers (,Winsock LSPs,). 
,In each Explorer, every element is rated as either ""Known"", ""Unknown"" or ""Potentially Unwanted"". The first and last categories carry a link to learn more about the particular item, and the second category invites users to submit the program to Microsoft SpyNet for analysis by community members.,[34],[35], The Software Explorer feature has been removed from Windows Defender in Windows 7.,[36],
,
,Conversion to Full Antivirus,[,edit,],
,Windows Defender was released with Windows Vista and Windows 7, serving as their built-in ,anti-spyware, component.,[37], In Windows Vista and Windows 7, Windows Defender was superseded by ,Microsoft Security Essentials,, an ,antivirus, product from Microsoft which provided protection against a wider range of malware. Upon installation, Microsoft Security Essentials disabled and replaced Windows Defender.,[38],[39],
,In Windows 8, Microsoft upgraded Windows Defender into an ,antivirus, program very similar to Microsoft Security Essentials for Windows 7,,[3], and it also uses the same anti-malware engine and ,virus definitions, from MSE. Microsoft Security Essentials itself does not run on Windows versions beyond 7.,[38], In Windows 8 or later, Microsoft Defender Antivirus is on by default. It switches itself off upon installation of a third-party anti-virus package.,[40],[41],
,Following the consumer-end launch, ,Windows Server 2016, was the first version of Windows Server to include Windows Defender.,[42], 
,
,Ongoing Evolution of UI and Brands,[,edit,],
,UI changes,[,edit,],
,Until ,Windows 10 version 1703,, Windows Defender had a dedicated GUI similar to Microsoft Security Essentials.,[3], Additionally, ,Windows Security and Maintenance, tracked the status of Windows Defender. With the first release of Windows 10, Microsoft removed the ""Settings"" dialog box from Windows Defender's GUI in favor of a dedicated page in the ,Settings, app. Then, in the 1703 update, Microsoft tried to merge both Windows Defender's GUI and Windows Security and Maintenance into a unified ,UWP app, called  ,Windows Defender Security Center, (WDSC).,[43], Users could still access original GUI by alternative methods,,[44],[45], until the ,1803 update,, which saw the UI removed altogether.,[a], The Security and Maintenance app, however, was never removed.
,With the release of Windows Server 2016, Microsoft introduced a Defender module for ,PowerShell,, which allows interacting with Windows Defender via a ,command-line interface, (CLI).,[51],
,Microsoft continued to decouple the management front-end from the core antivirus. In addition, to WDSC and ,PowerShell,, it is possible to manage the antivirus via ,Windows Admin Center,, ,Group Policy,, ,WMI,, ,Microsoft Endpoint Manager,, and ,Microsoft Intune,'s ""tenant attach"" feature.,[52],
,
,Changes in branding and business focus,[,edit,],
,In ,Windows 10 version 1703,, Microsoft renamed Windows Defender, calling it Windows Defender Antivirus.,[53], ,Windows Firewall, and ,Microsoft SmartScreen, also saw their names changed to Windows Defender Firewall and Windows Defender SmartScreen.,[54], Microsoft added other components under the ""Windows Defender"" brand name, including ,Windows Defender Application Guard, (WDAG),,[54], ,Window Defender Exploit Guard, (WDEG),,[54], ,Windows Defender Application Control,,,[55], and ,Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection, (Defender ATP).,[55],
,A year later, Microsoft began dissolving the Windows Defender brand in favor a of the cloud-oriented ,""Microsoft Defender"" brand,. The company removed WDSC from the brand in the ,1809 update,, renaming it ,Windows Security Center (WSC),.,[56], The ,2004 update, renamed Windows Defender Antivirus, calling it ,Microsoft Defender Antivirus,, as Microsoft extended Defender ATP's capabilities beyond the Windows OS.,[57],[58], As part of this branding change and shift in focus, they have also changed branding of Windows Defender Firewall and Windows Defender Smartscreen into ""Microsoft Defender Firewall"" and ""Microsoft Defender Smartscreen"" Respectively,,[59],[60], although the former branding name is also often still ambiguously used despite this branding change.,[61],[62],
,
,Windows Defender Offline,[,edit,],
,Windows Defender Offline (formerly known as Standalone System Sweeper),[63], is a stand-alone anti-malware program that runs from bootable removable media (e.g. CD or USB flash drive) designed to scan infected systems while the Windows operating system is offline.,[64], Since ,Windows 10 Anniversary Update, in 2016, the option to boot into Windows Defender Offline can be initiated from within Windows itself, negating the need for the separate boot disk.
,
,Microsoft Defender for Individuals,[,edit,],
,Microsoft Defender for Individuals, was released to the general public in June 2022 for Windows 10, Windows 11, Mac OS, Android, and iOS devices.,[65],[66], On Windows it works alongside Microsoft's first and third-party antivirus solutions, such as Microsoft Defender Antivirus.
,Microsoft Defender for Individuals requires a Microsoft 365 personal or family license.,[67],
,Microsoft Defender for Individuals is a stand-alone app that adds central management with visibility of family devices, as well as Identity Theft Monitoring (in supported regions,[68],) to existing anti-malware features on Windows devices. On macOS and Android, the app includes its own anti-malware protection and on Android and iOS it also includes web protection (malicious link detection).,[69], 
,All supported platforms share a common user interface, which is also accessible from a web browser through Microsoft's ,My Defender portal,.
,
,Mitigated security vulnerability,[,edit,],
,On May 5, 2017, Tavis Ormandy, a vulnerability researcher from ,Google,, discovered a ,security vulnerability, in the ,JavaScript, analysis module (,NScript,) of Microsoft Antimalware Engine (,MsMpEngine,) that impacted Windows Defender, ,Microsoft Security Essentials, and ,System Center Endpoint Protection,. By May 8, 2017, Microsoft had released a patch to all affected systems. ,Ars Technica, commended Microsoft for its unprecedented patching speed and said that the disaster had been averted.,[70],[71],
,
,Reviews,[,edit,],
,During a December 2017 test of various anti-malware software carried out by ,AV-TEST, on Windows 10, Windows Defender earned 6 out of 6 points in detection rate of various malware samples, earning its ""AV-TEST Certified"" seal.,[72],
,During a February 2018 ""Real-World Protection Test"" performed by ,AV-Comparatives,, Windows Defender achieved a 100% detection rate of malicious URL samples, along with 3 ,false positive, results.,[73],
,An AV-TEST test of Windows Defender in October 2019 demonstrated it provides excellent protection both against viruses and 0-day / malware attacks.,[74],
,On December 1, 2021, AV-TEST gave Defender a maximum protection score of 34 points after successfully managing to detect ten out of ten ransomware samples in a lab test.,[75],
,
,Criticisms,[,edit,],
,Microsoft Defender has often been subjected to criticisms related to privacy concerns, performance issues, and intrusive behavior in recent versions of Microsoft Windows operating systems. Microsoft Defender features cloud file analysis and file submission under Microsoft Spynet Membership which eventually became Microsoft Advanced Protection Service (MAPS) when opted in with basic or advanced membership collects user data and sends to Microsoft which arises privacy concerns among users.,[76],[77], The cloud integration of Microsoft Defender also rose concerns among privacy advocates. The MsmpEngine of Microsoft Defender in recent versions of Windows was found to be using high amounts of system resources, especially CPU Resources when Real-time protection and scheduled scan is configured to be turned on.,[78], This issue is more apparent in PCs with Intel CPUs.,[79], Microsoft defender is configured by default to take up 50% of the system's CPU resources available by default, although this can be configured using ,Group Policy Editor, along with limiting the process of MsmpEngine to use a Low Priority Process during a Realtime Scan and customizing scheduled scans.,[80],[81], Recent Windows Versions also deeply integrated Microsoft Defender with the operating system using mechanisms like Early Boot Anti-Malware, Tamper Protection, etc., making it almost impossible to remove or uninstall. Although these are useful to prevent malware from disabling or removing the antivirus itself, they also lead to frustration among users who utilize and seek 3rd party alternatives.,[82],[83],[84],[85], In late-July 2020, Microsoft Defender began to classify modifications of the ,hosts file, that blocks Microsoft telemetry and data collection servers as being a severe security risk.,[86],[87],

The following is a list of players, both past and current, who have been selected to play in the ,NFL,'s annual ,Pro Bowl, game, beginning with the 1950 season.

,Between 1961 and 1969, the NFL and AFL played separate all-star games. This list includes players who were selected to play in the ,American Football League All-Star game, during that period.

The following is a list of players, both past and current, who have been selected to play in the ,NFL,'s annual ,Pro Bowl, game, beginning with the 1950 season.
,Between 1938 and 1942, an NFL all star team played the league champion in the NFL All-Star Game. Participants in these games are not recognized by the NFL as Pro Bowlers, and they are not included in this list. No games were played between 1943 and 1950.
,Between 1961 and 1969, the NFL and AFL played separate all-star games. This list includes players who were selected to play in the ,American Football League All-Star game, during that period.

,Elections in Colorado, are held to fill various local, state and federal positions. ,Special elections, may be held to fill vacancies at other points in time.
,In a 2020 study, Colorado was ranked 7th among the 50 states for ease of voting in ,presidential elections,.,[1],
,
,
,Electoral system,[,edit,],
,Electoral precincts, are drawn by the county clerk and recorder and have on average 1365 registered voters.,[2],[3],
,
,Party system,[,edit,],
,A political organization is a political party when its candidate for governor receives at least 10 percent of the vote in the latest ,general election,.,[4], Party members choose their party's nominees for the general election in a ,primary election,.,[5], Party members also elect the county central committee members at the primary election.,[6], Colorado uses an ,open primary, system, whereby party members and unaffiliated voters may vote in the party's primary.,[7],[8],[9],
,There are three distinct aspects of party organization: the committee system, the designating assembly system, and the convention system.,[6], The systems operate with respect to public offices for the state, counties, US congressional districts, state senatorial districts, state representative districts, and state judicial districts. (Judicial district elections only concern the district attorney;,[10], ,district court, and ,county court, judges are nominated by a judicial nominating commission of the judicial district.,[11],)
,
,The designating assembly system designates candidates to be elected (at a primary election) as party nominees for public office.,[12], A precinct caucus is held in each ,precinct, by each political party, where party members (who bother to show up) elect delegates to the county assembly.,[13],[14], The county assembly chooses candidates to contest the primary election for county elected offices and elects members of the state assembly and district assemblies (congressional assemblies, judicial district assemblies, senatorial assemblies, and representative assemblies).,[8],[15],[14], Candidates may also be nominated by petition.,[9], The party's state assembly governs the party when it is in session.,[16],
,The major purpose of the convention system is to ultimately select delegates to the national convention.,[17], The precinct caucus also elects delegates to the county convention, and the county conventions elect delegates for the state convention and district conventions (congressional conventions, judicial district conventions, senatorial conventions, and representative conventions).,[13],[15],[14], The state convention elects members to the party's national committee, nominates electors to the US ,Electoral College,, and elects delegates to the national convention.,[18],
,The committee system runs the party, while the state central committee governs the party when the party's state assembly is not in session.,[16], The precinct caucus nominates candidates for the county central committee, composed of precinct committeeman, which are elected at the primary election.,[19],[20], The county central committee runs the party within the county, through a committee chairman who is assisted by an executive committee in larger counties.,[19], The county central committee chairman also compose the state central committee along with additional members.,[16], The district committees (for congressional districts, judicial districts, senatorial districts, and representative districts) are also composed of the county central committee chairman.,[20],[21], The state central committees also have a state chairman and a state executive committee.,[22],
,To be designated to contest the party's nomination at a primary election, a candidate must receive at least 30 percent of the delegates' votes at a party assembly.,[23], Candidates may also petition party members to contest the primary election, with at least 20 percent of the party members (of those registered within that political subdivision) for offices of or within a county, 30 percent for districts larger than a county, and 2 percent for statewide offices.,[24],[10],
,
,Election procedure,[,edit,],
,A combination of local caucuses, primaries and general elections determines the top state offices (Governor, Secretary of State and Attorney General), as well as U.S. and state legislative races. Presidential races are decided by primary and general elections, with no caucuses. Legislation passed in 2016 instituted open primaries beginning with the 2018 races, and eliminated caucuses for presidential races starting in 2020.,[9],[25],
